Brief Hospital Course:
 mr. [**known firstname 4884**] [**known lastname 6164**] is a 70-year-old man with multiple myeloma and plasma cell leukemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, dm type 2, who presents with fever and neutropenia. he had recently received outpatient chemotherapy with velcade on [**2173-7-26**]. . # fever with neutropenia: in the ed, the patient had a temperature of 102.9 with a wbc count of 21.1 with 1% neutrophils (anc ~210). there were no localizing signs of infection on examination. cxr was negative in the ed. he was treated empirically with 1x vancomycin, 1x levaquin and 1x cefepime. on the floor, antibiotic coverage was changed to iv cefepime to cover gi organisms and pseudomonas. the patient remained febrile and therefore acyclovir was added since the patient was recently admitted with disseminated zoster. the lesions on his body, however, appeared to be healing. the patient still remained febrile and vancomycin and azithromycin were added as per id consultation. on [**2173-7-28**] the patient became progressively tachypneic to the 30s, sbp 140-150s, increasingly tachycardic to the 140s, diaphoretic with o2 saturation of 99% on 1l. ekg showed sinus tachycardia with no evidence of ischemia, cardiac enzymes were negative x 1. he continued to have high grade temperatures as high as 103 f. blood cultures just grew gram positive cocci in clusters. he is transferred to [**hospital unit name 153**] for closer monitoring for sepsis/sirs. in the icu, antifungal therapy was started with caspofungin. a rij central line was placed for better access. initial cxr was negative for any infiltrate. repeat cxr the next day revealed a right lower lobe pneumonia. ct scan was then obtained which showed two focal areas of consolidation, one in the left upper lobe and the other in the right lower lobe, which demonstrate a surrounding ground-glass appearance, most consistent with invasive aspergillosis. treatment was then initiated with iv voriconazole and caspofungin was discontinued. the patient then stabilized in the icu and was transferred back to the floor on [**2173-7-30**]. the patient continued to have low grade fevers and baseline tachycardia. his wbc count remained low with anc between 300-400. pulmonary evaluation was obtained to evaluate the possibility of doing a bronchoscopy for the purpose of getting a tissue diagnosis according to the recommendations of infectious diseases. pulmonary felt that treatment would be continued despite a negative biopsy and therefore the risk of undergoing such a procedure was considered too risky given his degree of neutropenia. blood cultures were subsequently all negative. since the patient was responding to treatment, voriconazole was continued po, acyclovir was continued at prophylactic doses po, vancomycin was discontinued and levaquin po was added for a two week time course. the patient was discharged on this regimen. follow up ct scan in two weeks was ordered and the patient was scheduled to follow up with dr. [**last name (stitle) **] in the pulmonary clinic. upon discharge the patient was persistently neutropenic. this was considered his baseline due to severe and progressive involvement of his bone marrow. g-csf was not thought to be of any use given the degree of bone marrow invasion. on discharge he had been afebrile for more than 3 days and was markedly improved clinically with stable vital signs. . # respiratory alkalosis/metabolic acidosis: on admission the patient was noted to have a low bicarbonate level of 16 that later dropped further to 12 on [**7-28**] when the patient was evaluated by the icu team. abg at the time revealed a respiratory alkalosis with a ph of 7.49, pco2 17 with a concomitant non gap metabolic acidosis. this was thought to be secondary to tachypneic secondary to sepsis and his underlying pulmonary infection. in addition, the patient was thought to have renal tubular acidosis either secondary to his multiple myeloma (proximal rta) or due to chronic renal failure with a persistently low bicarbonate on previous admissions. with improvement in his respiratory status, repeat blood gases showed a neutral ph and his bicarbonate began to rise steadily up to 17 on discharge, likely due to his resolving pulmonary infection. once back on the floor, formal renal consultation was obtained for further evaluation and guidance in treatment. no treatment was necessary since the patient's acid-base status improved on its own with treatment of his underlying disease. . # mm/plasma cell leukemia: the patient had been receiving chemotherapy up until this admission with the last dose given on [**2173-7-26**]. during his hospital stay no chemotherapy was given due to his complicated hospital course with persistent neutropenia. a portocath was placed the day prior to discharge and the patient was advised to follow up in clinic for possible future treatments. it is unlikely that he will be able to tolerate velcade again and other treatments will have to be explored. his last dose of chemotherapy was on [**7-26**]. . # thrombocytopenia/anemia - thought to be secondary to bone marrow invasion of plasma cells with concomitant chemotherapeutic effects. mr. [**known lastname 6164**] received multiple transfusions of both platelets and prbcs in order to maintain his counts. no asa or heparin was given while in hospital except for minimal amounts of heparin to flush central lines. upon discharge his hct was 26.4 and his plts were 81k. . # chronic renal insufficiency: the patient has a baseline cr of [**1-21**]. medications were dosed according to his renal function. upon discharge his cr. was 1.1. . # htn - patient was hypotensive in the ed requiring fluid boluses, on the floor he remained borderline hypotensive requiring ivf. after stabilization the patient had a stable blood pressure and did not require any antihypertensive medications. . # dm - the patient was monitored throughout his stay with qid finger sticks with sliding scale insulin. the patient did not require insulin and his glucose values where consistently within normal limits. on the last two days of admission, finger sticks and insulin were discontinued. he was discharged without any oral hypoglycemics. . # hyperlipidemia - lipitor was held during this admission. . # ppx - neutropenic precautions, bowel regimen, no heparin due to low plts",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

his cardiac enzymes bumped slightly, but this was thought to be likely secondary to acute renal faliure. additionally, previous tte showed adequate cardiac function. - vancomycin was re-started for mrsa coverage, meropenem for gram negative coverage as patient could have esbl klebs from prolonged hospital stay, flagyl to prophylactically treat c. difficile. - cultures were drawn and followed. - stress dose steroids were re-started. - pressors were also re-started, and increased as needed, initially levophed, however neo and vasopressin were also started. given the patient's recurrent sepsis and increasing pressor requirements, the family decided to withdrawal care in accordance with the patient's wishes, as he expressed to the staff and his family that he did not want to continue on in his current ventilator and pressor-dependent state. patient was maintained on pressors and the ventilator until his family members were able to arrive from various parts of the country. on [**2126-10-10**], care was withdrawn in accordance with the patient's and wife's wishes, and he was extubated. the patient passed away with his family at the bedside on the evening of [**2126-10-10**]. . # respiratory failure:  patient was intubated upon arrival to micu for respiratory distress and altered mental status. initially thought to be due to volume overload in the setting of rbc transfusions, further compromised by copd caused either by fluids, chf or trali. the work-up for transfusion reaction was negative  however, anaphalyxis, wegeners, pe, pneumonia and sepsis could not be rulled out. leni's demonstrated no dvts, and further cta to evaluate for pe was held due to concern for arf. with further imaging, localized consolidation and bilateral effusions suggest more infectious cause, and pt was emperically treated with levo and zosyn. pna was confirmed by gnr on sputum culture - citrobacter and e coli, both sensitive to ciprofloxacin, so zosyn was stopped and levofloxacin was continued for a total of 15 days. . initially, plans were being made for placement of a tracheostomy, however once patient developed recurrent sepsis, care was withdrawn as noted above. . #) acute renal failure in setting of cadaveric transplant: initial epsiode of arf likely combination of pre-renal effects of hypotension and nephrotoxicity of elevated prograft levels. arf likely pre-renal in nature given hypotension and shock. u/s done previously this stay within normal limits.  urine eos negative, and urine electrolytes unrevealing.  on [**9-21**] prograft level found to be greatly elevated, and prograft was held for 4 days, then restarted.  pt had medabolic acidosis, which was treated with iv bicarb to attempt to decrease respiratory rate. creatinine returned to [**location 25620**] of 1.7-19.  in setting of reoccurance of shock on [**10-5**], creatinine again increased to 2.5.  elevated creatinine was likely prerenal in the setting of hypotension and pressors . the renal team followed along and made recommendations regarding the dosing of his cellcept, bactrim, and other medications. . #) thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy:  coagulopathy was felt to be likely precipitated by sepsis picture. platelets decreased [**9-23**] and pt, ptt, inr elevated.  hit was negative, but all heparin products were stopped, except given schistocytes seen on peripheral smear concern for dic vs ttp.  fibrinogen was checked and was initially <100 (64), but elevated.  fdp was elevated as was the d-dimer and ldh.  habtoglobin was normal, and coumbs was negative.  heme consulted, felt ttp was unlikely given small amount of schistocytes, and that cause was multifactorial. causes include sepsis/shock, transfusion related, medication induced, idiopathic. overtime, both coagulation and thrombocytopenia trended back towards normal and dic labs tranded downwards as well.  heparin sq was restarted without further thrombocytopenia.  with recurrent sepsis on [**10-5**], platlets decreased again . #) mental status changes: staff and wards team noted possible change in mental status around time of hypoxia and sob. given the events of the evening, it is possible that those accounted for his mental status changes. since his arrival at the micu, it has been difficult to assess mental status, but at baseline he is pleasant and aware of recent events.  head ct showed possible l parital occiptal infarct, which neurology feels is likely unrelated.  tsh was checked, and only slightly elevated at 5.5. as sedation was weaned off and pt had increased responsiveness.",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Brief Hospital Course:
 the patient is a 73 year old right-handed woman with a history of dm, pvd s/p l bka, and af not on warfarin presenting with aphasia with predominantly comprehensive deficits, r hemianopia, and a r neglect with l gaze preference, likely secondary to cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke. her initial head ct did not show an initial infarct despite the presumed extended time from symptom onset. the patient was very hypertensive, and she was also agitated and therefore given two does of 0.25 mg lorazepam. she was started on a heparin infusion empirically given the history of atrial fibrillation off anticoagulation (stopped for her bka) and that the suspected area of infarct was not large. the patient was admitted to the neuro icu for further management. the next morning, the patient was noted to be somnolent, requiring extreme noxious stimuli to awaken and subsequently promptly fall back asleep. her neurologic exam was significant for decreased spontaneous movement on the rue with depressed withdrawal on the rue compared to lue. repeat ct failed to show any infarct. the patient became very agitated and aggressive in mri and was so it was not completed. ltm was done for concern of seizure but only showed generalized encephalopathy. lumbar puncture was done and showed normal csf findings. the dense somnolence was thought to be due to the lorazepam given that the patient's daughter reported a similar reaction to sedating meds in the past. however, on [**2196-6-23**], while still on ltm, the patient was seen to suffer a large left hemisphere seizure that generalized. this seizure prompted a parasympathetic response and her heart rate decreased to the 30s and she became hypotensive. code blue was called and the patient received several rounds of atropine and epi as well as being sedated, intubated, and started on dopa and levo. the patient's brain waves on eeg were noted to go flat during this time and based on this the patient was started on hypothermic therapy for 24 hours. after the cooling was complete, an mri was done that showed patchy left mca/pca infarcts as well as cerebellar lesions. the patient was weaned quickly off the pressors and then the sedation. she remained unresponsive to stimuli and this was thought to be due to metabolic/toxic causes as the patient had developed [**last name (un) **] at this time, which could be causing the unresponsiveness by either uremia or decreased clearence of previous sedation. nephrology was consulted [**6-26**] and they suggested a furosemide trial, to which the patient responded, but hemodialysis was eventually pursued to improve clearance and address her significant volume overload. on [**6-29**], she had an additional hypotensive episode with fever and was found to have thickened respiratory secretions and was treated empirically for ventilator-associated pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin. she was subsequently found to have e.coli bacteremia and bacteriuria and some in her sputum, so her antibiotics were tailored according to her sensitivities to ciprofloxacin only. seizure management and minimization of sedating medications was optimized at this time, but her mental status remained unchanged and poor. recurrent discussions with the patient's family (with no assigned health care proxy), including her daughter, nephew, and brother (the patriarch of the family) repeatedly indicated a desire to keep the patient full code. a final discussion occurred on [**2196-7-7**] after the patient's clinical status had not changed for several days, and the family made the decision to make the patient comfort measures only. after only a few hours on a morphine infusion and after being extubated, the patient passed away. she was pronounced deceased at 1700 on [**2196-7-7**].",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Brief Hospital Course:
 79m initially transferred from osh for interventional pulmonary evaluation of worsening inspiratory stridor, which was later identified as tracheobronchomalacia.  other issues included renal failure and metabolic derangement, resolving mssa bacteremia.  his current issues include a pleural based lung mass, anemia with occult positive stool, infections, hepatitis and paroxismal afib. . a.  pleural based mass:  please see attached ct reports.  this pleural based mass on the right was stable on his various ct scans.  radiology was concerned about it being a multilobulated right pleural-based mass without significant enhancement, local invasion or associated thoracic lymphadenopathy. no primary neoplasm identified elsewhere within the torso. this may represent post- infectious sequelae, mesothelioma, nerve sheath tumor or metastatic disease from unknown primary. if clinically indicated, biopsy could be performed.  question as whether this is an old finding or a more recent one.  of note, his respiratory status is stable on room air at time of transfer. . b.  tracheobronchomalacia/copd:  on initial arrival, patient had severe stridor concerning for urgent requirement of intubation. however, continuous bronchodilator treatment overnight induced near complete resolution of the stridor, and urgent intubation was not required.  on hospital day two, however, pt was intubated for airway protection given continued poor mental status and underwent bronchoscopy at that time which revealed no airway stenosis or external compression without significant tracheobronchomalacia.  following stabilization, pt was extubated and again required continuous bronchodilator therapy (including racemic epinephrine) as well as corticosteroids as empiric therapy for restrictive airway disease, with ultimate resolution of stridor.  therefore, it was felt that pt most likely had bronchospasm as a result of his metabolic derangement and renal insufficiency/uremia.  he has been stable on room air for several days now with nebulizer treatments written prn. the steroids are being tapered by 10mg of prednisone per day as his respiratory status has been stable and there is a concern for multiple infections including sigmoid colitis.  he is currently on 40mg. . c.  infections:  his wbc had trended down to about 11 but has risen back up slowly to 18.  this can partly be attributed to the steroid treatment, but also is concerning for infection. 1.  ct scan showed sigmoid colitis (please see attached reports).  we do not think this is ischemic colitis as he was ruled out with a normal lactate and bicarb.  of note he was occult blood positive and complained of abdominal pain especially when defecating.  he is being treated empirically for c diff (antigen negative x2 thus far) and for gram negative coverage with levoquin started today [**2189-6-25**]. given his recent high doses of steroids and his colitis, would have a low threshold for examining for free air if his abdominal pain worsens. 2. mssa bacteremia: per report, 12/12 bottles at osh and started on nafcillin on [**2189-6-15**], though no positive surveillance cultures here.  remained hemodynamically stable, no septic physiology and afebrile.  both tte and tee (performed while intubated) were negative for endocarditis.  no evidence for septic emboli on complete ct chest/abdomen/pelvis.  pt had initially complained of back pain on admission to osh, however denied this when he arrived here, so no search for epidural or paraspinal abscesses was made.  therefore, the source remains unknown for this infection.  would continue the nafcillin for 4-6weeks. 3.concern about the right pleural based mass is- does it represent an infectious source or malignancy?  see discussion above. . d.  acute on chronic renal failure: creatinine 2.7, fena 1.2%, no eos on smear, and bland sediment.  from chronic renal insufficiency (cr 1.7), but was thought to have developed acute tubular necrosis, though the etiology was unclear. nevertheless, uremia was felt to be the primary etiology of patient's poor mental status as well as partial contributor to bronchospasm.  patient did require phos binders.  his renal function has returned to it's original state with a cr of 1.7. he was started in epoetin 4000 units sc qmwf. . e.  heptatitis: no known hx liver disease, hep serologies show    hbsag    hbsab  hbcab       hav ab igm hav  negative positive positive  positive  hepatitis c serology hcv ab  negative  hep b e antigen/antibodies were not evaluated during inpatient admission, but should be followed.  his liver enzymes are remaining high at alt ast ld(ldh) alkphos totbili  82* 158* 652*   136*   1.2 .",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 this patient is a 73m with a history of gerd and hyperlipidemia who presents with abdominal pain and fever following a colonscopy/ polypectomy on the day prior to admission. . the patient reports he underwent a scheduled screening colonoscopy on the day prior to admission without issue. according to the endoscopy note, there were no documented complications during the procedure. following the procedure, he ate a lunch consisting of a chicken [**location (un) 6002**], soup, and a cookie. shortly thereafter he describes severe, crampy abdominal pain and shaking rigors. when these symptoms persisted and his pain progressed throughout the course of the day, he presented to an osh for further evaluation. at the osh, the patient underwent ct which showed severe colonic inflammation, but without evidence of perforation. the patient required antiemetics and pain control, he was given zosyn x 1, and was transferred to [**hospital1 18**] for further work-up. . in the [**hospital1 18**] ed, initial vs were: 101.1 85 109/61 16 95% 4l. his ct scan from the osh was re-read as circumferential wall thickening in focal segment of ascending [**hospital1 499**] consistent with colitis inflammation/infection. given bps in the 80s, he was given 2l ns and started on low-dose peripheral levophed. he was given vancomycin x 1 given concern for an evolving septic picture. a rij was placed for access. . on arrival to the micu, the patient reports no current symptoms. he states his pain is significantly better controlled than earlier today. he denies any n/v/d or blood in the stool. he does endorses a sensation of discomfort on the r-side of his chest with a deep breath. denies shortness of breath.

Brief Hospital Course:
 #microperforation: he presented with fever, chills, abdominal pain and hypotension following colonoscopy with polypectomy with imaging revealing a small amount of contained air near the biopsy site suggestive of small perforation.    he was initially admitted to the icu for hypotension where he was fluid resuscitated and on levophed for less than twenty four hours. hypotension was thought to be due to dehydration secondary to gi prep with superimposed distributive process due to transient bacteremia with microperforation from enteric source from colonoscopy. serial blood cultures did not grow organisms. he was managed conservatively with iv antibiotics (vancomycin, zosyn) and bowel rest. his abdominal pain resolved after 48 hours and his diet was slowly advanced to regular.  his fever curve improved and his antibiotics were narrowed to ciprofloxacin and flagyl. . #hyperlipidemia:  he was continued on home dose simvastatin . #gerd: he was continued on home dose omeprazole",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

History of Present Illness:
 this 72m pediatrician was diagnosed with t-cell lymphoma 4 weeks

Brief Hospital Course:
 the patient is a 72-yo retired pediatrician with a recently diagnosed t-cell lymphoma s/p one cycle of chop (d+26), who presented with fever, rash, persistent dry cough, elevated lfts, acute renal failure, and worsening oxygen requirement, transferred out of the icu for continued care. he was also noted to have one episode of brbpr and multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on exertion, which were symptomatic with palpitations and dizziness, and resolved with rest. . #. fevers - the pt presented with fever, leukocytosis with left shift and bandemia, persistent non-productive cough, and worsening oxygen requirement, raising concern for a pneumonia. cxr on admission was unremarkable, and non-contrast chest ct was also non-specific. culture data has all shown ngtd, with urine legionella antigen negative, mycoplasma pneumonia dna not detected, and beta-glucan and galactomannan currently pending. he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, aztreonam, azithromycin, and flagyl. the infectious disease team was involved with his care. his hypoxia greatly improved since his admission, with resolution of his dyspnea and tachypnea, and weaned off oxygen to room air. he defervesced and remained afebrile >72hrs, so his antibiotic regimen was changed to meropenem and azithromycin. a repeat portable cxr was non-diagnostic, and the patient completed his full course azithromycin as an inpatient. he was discharged on daily ertapenem to be taken as an outpatient for 7 more days. . #. hypoxia - the pt presented with a significant oxygen requirement, dyspnea, and tachypnea. his cxr was unremarkable as above, and non-contrast chest ct was non-specific. he was treated as above for a probable pneumonia, although all micro data was negative. he significantly improved with this treatment, with resolution of his tachypnea, dyspnea, and hypoxia. his sob also improved with an ipratropium inhaler that had been started for mild wheezing. a repeat portable cxr was again non-diagnostic. his antibiotic regimen was completed as above. . #. h/o dvt - the patient had a history of dvt approx 4 weeks prior to this hospitalization, being treated with coumadin at home for anticoagulation. his inr was supratherapeutic to >7 on admission, and reportedly up to 9 at osh. he received vitamin k, and his inr trended down to below 2.0 prior to restarting his coumadin. he was discharged to home with a plan to restart his coumadin at 5mg daily for now, with daily inr checks and adjustments to be made to his coumadin dose. he would be bridged to a therapeutic level with lovenox as an outpatient. . #. atrial tachycardia - the patient had an episode of a-fib with rvr in the micu, in the setting of increased sympathetic tone with infection, fever, and dehydration. this was treated with iv lopressor, and the pt had a good response to this. the cardiology team was involved, and recommended continuing on a low-dose beta-blocker such as metoprolol 25mg. the patient was started on metoprolol 12.5 for ectopy noted on his telemetry, but he developed wheezing after this, so the medication was discontinued with relief of wheezing. he then had a tte that was unrevealing. he was noted to have more episodes of symptomatic a-fib with rvr while on the floor, so he was started on a low-dose ccb with good control and no further events on telemetry. this low-dose ccb was changed to a long-acting formulation prior to discharge. . #. brbpr - the patient described 1 episode of brbpr when trying to move his bowels. he noted that this was more bleeding than he has had in the past (h/o hemorrhoidal bleeding). he also has known sigmoid diverticula, seen on a screening colonoscopy here 5 years ago. his vital signs were stable, but his hematocrit slowly trended downward to 30 from 37.5 before stabilizing. his bleeding was felt to most likely be hemorrhoidal bleeding in the setting of his low platelets, but given the recent supratherapeutic inr, the gi team was consulted as other causes of bleeding such as diverticula were also being considered. the gi team also felt that this was likely hemorrhoidal bleeding and not a more serious source given his small amount of bleeding. the did however recommend further work-up of the gallbladder, including labwork and an mrcp. the patients hematocrits stabilized prior to discharge and he had no further evidence of bleeding. he was continued on protonix. . #. thrombocytopenia - the patient presented with thrombocytopenia and continued decrease in platelet count throughout the admission. he was not on any medications suspected to cause thrombocytopenia, although he had recently been on levofloxacin which may have contributed. hitt was also considered given the diagnosis of a dvt 1 month prior that likely would have been treated with heparin. heparin-dependent antibodies were negative for hitt, with anti-platelet antibody pending, but the patient's platelet count was recovering prior to discharge, up to 178 from a nadir of 50. . #. abdominal discomfort - the patient initially presented to osh with elevated lfts and ruq us findings of gallbladder wall thickening, which was confirmed on ruq us here. the ggt on admission was not helpful as it was indicative of both bony and hepatic sources of elevated alk phos. there was concern for lymphomatous involvement rather than infection. the patient's lfts continue to trend downward without intervention, and he had only very mild discomfort on deep palpation of ruq, without any associated symptoms. his flagyl was discontinued given the low likelihood of cholecystitis, and he was seen by gi and general surgery, who recommended further work-up including a hida scan / mrcp. his hida scan was negative for cholecystitis, with hepatitis serologies, cmv viral load, [**doctor first name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody, and total igg pending on discharge. mrcp was not done given his improvement and the negative hida scan. . #. rash - the patient initially presented with a diffuse erythematous blanching maculopapular rash. initial ddx included drug rash to levaquin, infectious, or lymphomatous involvement. evaluation by dermatology advised that the rash is most likely a drug reaction to levaquin, and it was recommended that he use topical clobetasol for treatment. the rash continued to improve in color and extent during the hospitalization, and was resolved prior to his discharge. . #. acute renal failure - the patient initially presented to osh with cr 2.2, up from baseline 1.1. urine lytes reportedly consistent with pre-renal picture, and renal u/s essentially normal. his creatinine improved to baseline with ivf hydration. . #. t-cell lymphoma - the patient was diagnosed with t-cell lymphoma approx 4 weeks prior to his admission, and is now s/p first cycle of chop (d+26). further chemotherapy is to be determined by the pt's primary oncologist, dr. [**last name (stitle) 3315**], at [**hospital1 4601**]. continue communication with him regarding likelihood of receiving next cycle of chop. .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Brief Hospital Course:
 61 y/o man w/multiple medical problems including cad complicated by anoxic brain injury, with multiple infectious foci admitted with an episode of hypoxia, tachycardia, fevers and hypotesion likely secondary to urosepsis. hospital course by problem: . # hypotension/sepsis: the patient's bp was in the 70s systolic and he was admitted to icu from the ed. he was occasionally hypotensive to sbp in the 80s in the micu, but he responded quickly to fluids and antibiotics and he was soon called out to the floor. on the floor he was continued on antibiotics and was clinically improving, awaiting placement, but he had increased secretions requiring frequent suctioning so he was transferred back to the micu and then back to the floors once secretions were under better control. his blood pressures remained stable with sbps in the 90s-110s, the patient is currently afebrile and normotensive.  the combination of fevers, hypotension, and elevated wbc count support the diagnosis of sepsis.  possible sources included pulmonary source, [**month/day/year **], possible line infections(picc x 6 wks), urinary and abdominal source (cholecystitis as possibly suggested by elevated lft's). cxr was normal, [**month/day/year **] cultures from [**hospital1 **] showed pseudomonas and proteus species, but blood cultures have been negative.  no obvious areas of erythema were seen around the pick site or sacral decubitus ulcer.  ruq us showed no cholecystitis or biliary disease.  urine cultures grew klebsiella as a likely source.  the patient was started on zosyn for pseudomonas and klebsiella coverage and switched to meropenem due to thrombocytopenia. (see below). . # hypoxia/respiratory secretions: his initial hypoxia was thought to be due to transient mucus plugging. his hypoxia resolved in the micu with trach care and suctioning however when he was on the floors he was noted to have increasing secretions which appeared benign and related to the patient's inability to manage secretions, however the nursing staff could not meet his suctioning needs so he was transferred back to the micu for more frequent suctioning. in the icu, he had more yellow and thick secretions, so there was concern for possible pneumonia, especially given that he developed a low grade fever and tachycardia, however those have resolved. his chest x-rays have not revealed any clear new consolidation, so it is felt at this time he does not have a pna. patient is not hypoxic. with the addition of tobramycin nebs [**hospital1 **] and sublingual levsin, his secretions decreased. the patient also completed a 4 day course of prednisone (60 mg po x4 days) for possible copd/bronchitis component in the micu. his sputum culture grew pseudomonas (meropenem resistant), but the consensus is that the patient is likely colonized. he has been continued on tobramycin nebs [**hospital1 **] to assist with mucous secretions for pseudomonas colonization (this is often given to patients with cystic fibrosis) with the plan to continue tobramycin nebs for 2 weeks, started on [**2171-11-6**], to complete course on [**2171-11-20**]. he requires suctioning to assist in clearing secretions (at least q3hrs) and additionally receives atrovent, fluticasone, and xoponex in place of albuterol (due to tachycardia) to manage copd symptoms.  the patient may benefit from scopalamine patches in the future if his secretions worsen and this may be discussed with his family. . #uti: in the micu the patient was started on vanc/zosyn/flagyl for sepsis. however, urine cultures grew pseudomonas and klebsiella and [**date range **] cultures from [**hospital1 **] grew proteus and pseudomonas sensitive to imipenem, and he was colonized with pseudomonus in the lungs, so vanc/zosyn/flagyl were discontinued and he was started on meropenem (for pseudomonas both in the urine and possibly in the bone- osteomyelitis- as pseudomonas grew from the coccyx [**hospital1 **] as well). the patient is being treated for uti and osteomyelitis (klebsiella and pseudomonas), with meropenem for a 6wk course (day 1 = [**10-18**], the last day will be [**11-29**]). . # history of sacral decubitus ulcer complicated by osteomyelitis (mssa+ s/p 6 weeks vancomycin at [**hospital1 **]). as part of the sepsis work up the patient was found to have pseudomonas sensitive to imipenem in his sacral ulcer [**hospital1 **] so was started on meropenem as above. a sputum culture grew pseudomonas resistant to meropenem, so there was concern that the sacral [**hospital1 **] could have pseudomonas resistant to meropenem as well and a repeat sacral [**hospital1 **] culture was obtained on [**2171-11-9**] which did not grow pseudomonas but is growing vre. it is thought this is likely contamination from feces as the clinical exam does not support cellulitis. osteomyelitis by vre could be possible but since the patient has been afebrile with no leukocytosis for the past weeks, we chose not to treat and trend his fever curve and wbc.  one can consider adding linezolid to his antibiotics (14 days for cellulitis) or daptomycin (for longer course if suspect osteo) if the patient develops signs of active infection. during the hospital stay a [**date range **] nurse evaluated him and his [**date range **] was managed per the [**date range **] nurse recommendations. plastics was also consulted and recommended continuing the current care, and to maximize nutrition and blood glucose control to assist in healing. the patient completed a 14 day course of vit c and zinc for sacral decub care started on [**10-22**]. . # thrombocytopenia: the patient's platelets decreased over the first 2 days of his hospital stay with a nadir on [**10-18**].  zosyn was discontinued (changed to meropenem) on [**10-18**] and his platlets subsequently increased. hit antibody was negative, so heparin was restarted on [**10-19**].  patelets continued to increase. . # cad: per past reports his coronary artery disease is non-revascularizable, and he is allergic to betablockers. he was continued on asa 81 and a statin. . # chf, systolic: the patient was bolused with gental ivf when needed for hypotension in his initial few days of admission. also his ins and outs were monitored and he demonstrated equal fluid balance. he did not demonstrate signs of fluid overload. . # dm: nph was increased to 7 qam and 8 qpm, fsbg under better control, also with riss. . # acute on chronic renal failure: the patient's creatinine varied widely in the past. on presentation his cr was elevated, thought to be due to hypovolemia. his cr came back to baseline at 1.6-1.8 with fluid resuscitation. . # history of atrial fibrillation: the patient is not rate controlled or anticoagulated but he had a normal rhythm during his stay. he occasionally becomes tachycardic with persistent hrs in the 100s but this seems to have resolved with using xopinex instead of albuterol for nebulizers. he tends to get more tachycardic (120a) after suctioning and when he is uncomfortable. his tachycardia is felt less likely to be due to infection as he has been afebrile, and has a normal wbc count, and is on meropenem. he is still somewhat tachy with baseline hr in the 80s-100s . # altered ms - multifactorial in etiology and chronic. contributants include: anoxic brain injury, demylenating disease, known dementia, prior cva,and h/o thought disorder. he is able to follow some commands, and his mental status has improved during the course of his admission. . # agitation: patient had been scratching his upper extremities with multiple excoriations, likely due to agitation. he was given ativan 0.5 mg iv q4h:prn aggitation and was started on hydroxyzine 50 mg po q6h:prn anxiety. he has fewer excoriations, just on l arm now.  micu, continue. . #

[**first name (stitle) **] of plastic surgery, and with the infectious disease specialists, as specified in his dischrage worksheet. . # anticoagulation: given her history of venous thromboembolisms while on coumadin, mitral valve replacement, and history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the patient was placed on an argatroban drip prior to and after her surgical procedure. this was discontinued in the micu. she was then re-started on coumadin after transfer to the floor. she was kept on pneumboots until her inr was consistently theraputic (goal [**12-27**]). on discharge she was on coumadin 2 mg daily, given at 4pm. she will need continued [**month/day (3) **] work to monitor her inr and re-dose the coumadin as appropriate to achieve inr goal of [**12-27**]. . # acute kidney injury: the patient has had a slowly increasing creatinine (1.1 on day of discharge, 0.5-0.6 baseline) secondary to poor po intake and low volume status. we have held her lasix (normal dose furosemide 20 mg po daily) and lisinopril (normal dose 5 mg po daily). she will need monitoring of her kidney function by repeat creatinine measurements, and likely future re-initiation of her anti-hypertensives once her volume status corrects and kidney injury resolves. also, the patient has needed frequent repletion of her potassium and magnesium during her hospitalization, likely due to poor nutritional status and being on diuretics. now that her furosemide has been held, we anticipate these repletions will be less frequent. she will need monitoring of her electrolytes, and supplementation as needed, upon arrival to the skilled nursing facility. . # anemia: the patient has a chronic, normocytic anemia that slowly trended downwards during her admission. her stools were guaiac negative, and she had no evidence of hemolysis or dic. she likely had appreciable [**date range **] loss from her surgical site, as the wound vac output was sanguinous. her hematocrit never fell below 21%, but given her cardiac history, and physiologic signs such as tachycardia, as well as endorsed dyspnea, she received one unit of packed red [**date range **] cells on two separate occasions, and responded appropriately. . # malnutrition: the patient was assessed by nutrition who recommended tube feeds. the patient was [**first name9 (namepattern2) 5439**] [**last name (un) **] hoff tube placement for supplementation on three separate occasions and refused. this should be addressed in the future. . # tachypnea: the patient's respiratory rate has been elevated since admission, and does not correlate with the sensation of dyspnea. this appears to be chronic in nature, perhaps secondary to her severe kyphosis and an element of anxiety. there was no evidence of pulmonary embolism seen on two different chest cta. her cxrs were negative for pneumonia or signs of fluid overload. her oxygen saturation remained within normal limits on room air. occasionally she complained of dyspnea, and wheezes were heard on pulmonary exam. she responded well to ipratropium nebulizers.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

 this is a 43 year old male with hiv since [**2089**], last cd4 count of 150 and [**year (4 digits) 18617**] load of 200,000 with recent admission for pcp and new onset/diagnosed renal failure ([**date range (2) 62934**]) who presented earlier today with increasing shortness of breath, fevers and rigors over the last few days. the patient was found by hotel staff (staying at the comfort inn) to be weak today, ""collapsed"" by ed report. ems was called and noted patient to be hypoxic and dyspneic on arrival to ed with a respiratory rate in the 40's, sats 50% on ra, temperature of 103, tachycardic to 115 and bp of 137/87. a 100% non-rebreather was placed with improvement in saturations to 100% but still with respiratory rate in 30's to 40's.  a repeat chest x-ray showed bilateral, interstitial infiltrates in a central distribution (hilar), concerning for persistent pcp. [**name10 (nameis) **] was given 5 liters of intravenous fluids in the emergency department, primaquine, clindamycin, solumedrol 125 mg iv x 1, levofloxacin 750 mg iv x 1, ceftriaxone 1g iv x 1, and was admitted to the [**hospital unit name 153**]. on arrival to the [**hospital unit name 153**], patient was in respiratory distress and history was limited given his inability to speak in full sentences. he reports feeling better after last admission and reports taking his primaquine/clinda/levoflox as prescribed (id team counted pills and are suspicious of medicine non-compliance). of note, he was seen by his new primary care physician, [**name10 (nameis) **] [**last name (stitle) **], for follow up last week and was doing well, without any respiratory complaints. he felt recurrence of fevers/ chills /malaise a few days ago. denies dysuria, pain, chest discomfort, but is actively rigoring during conversation, with resp rate in 40's-50.

Brief Hospital Course:
 mr. [**known lastname 31292**] is a 43 yo man w/ hiv cd4 150, vl 200k, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). . # hypoxia/resp distress:  thought to be due to pcp, [**name10 (nameis) **] recent history and positive testing for pcp in sputum. was treated with primaquine, clindamycin, and prednisone with initial improvement, but then had questionable medicine non-compliance in recent days and clinical deterioration. of note, he was ruled out for tb on last admission and had negative infectious work up otherwise. on admission, id service counted pills and patient had too many in bottle to have taken anti-pcp meds daily, so unclear if this episode represents treatment failure or incomplete treatment for pcp. [**name10 (nameis) 227**] patient's distress, patient was semi-urgently intubated. patient was started on iv bactrim and solumedrol (allergy to bactrim very questionable). given low cd4 count, patient was also covered for other bacterial pna. bronchoscopy was performed with bal which was sent for gram stain, pcp, [**name10 (nameis) 18617**] pathogens and came back positive for pcp. [**name10 (nameis) **] histoplasma, legionella was also sent and were negative. cmv [**name10 (nameis) 18617**] load was checked as well as coccidomycoses serology which were negative. empiric cap coverage was started with azithromycin and ceftriaxone. patient then developed a rash, maculopapular, initially over his anterior chest which then spread to his face and legs. bactrim was discontinued since patient had had a questionable allergy to bactrim in the past. id was consulted regarding optimun treatement of pcp. [**name10 (nameis) **] was made to restart bactrim since this is the preferred treatment given his severe infection. patient was prophylactically treated one time with benadryl and did not subsequently develop the same rash. patient was also switched to vancomycin and ceftazidime for bacterial pneumonia coverage after id consultation. patient as continued on bactrim and steroids for pcp [**name initial (pre) 11091**]. serial cxrs remained unchanged showing bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates with sparing of the costophrenic/costodiaphragmatic angles. the patient's respiratory status improved with good ventilation/oxygenation by abg. patient was weaned off sedation and extubation was attempted on [**2103-8-16**]. patient did well in terms of his respiratory status, saturating well with abg 7.42/31/83. after approximately one hour, the patient began to decompensate rather acutely, became somnolent, unresponsive, with flaccid paralysis and therefore he was re-intubated for protection of his airway given the acute change in his mental status. after re-intubation, patient spiked a temperature of 101.7. patient was pancultured, sputum showed 1+ gram positive cocci and current antibiotics were continued with id following the patient closely. since this time, his respiratory status has remained stable with ongoing intubation pending workup of his mental status changes.  patient was successfully extubated on [**2103-8-20**] and saturating well with abg 7.44/37/118 post-extubation. patient was eventually weaned off o2 and sating 98% on room air.  patient continued on iv bactrim (to complete 21 day coarse) and tapered off steroids (methylprednisolone 20mg iv 11 day coarse).  cmv grew from bal culture and a repeat cmv [**date range 18617**] load was 13,400. for concern of cmv pneumonitis given the viremia and positive bronchial fluid culture, iv gancyclovir was started for a 1 week course (until [**8-31**]).  patient should then start po valgancyclovir 450mg po qod and this dose should be renally adjusted until cd4 count increases.  patient should have cmv [**month/day (4) 18617**] load checked on [**9-3**] to assess efficacy of treatment for cmv viremia.  if [**month/year (2) 18617**] load >600 copies would discontinue valgancyclovir and restart iv gancyclovir and treat for another 2 weeks at which time a cmv [**month/year (2) 18617**] load should be rechecked.  if [**month/year (2) 18617**] load <600, then switch from iv gancyclovir to po valgancyclovir and continue as directed above. patient completed methylprednisolone 11 day taper on day of discharge.  patient will also need to be on azithromycin 1200mg qwk as prophylaxis for [**doctor first name **] and bacrtim ss po qd after completion of iv bactrim for pcp [**name initial (pre) 1102**]. . # change in mental status: patient acutely decompensated after extubation, non-responsive, with flaccid muscle tone, reflexes present in both upper and lower extremities, toes were equivocal, no focal deficits but appeared to be in semi-comatose state. patient may have seized or post ictal since seen to be posturing at times, tremor present intermittently. ct head was negative for acute bleed or mass, although it was performed w/out contrast. lp performed subsequently which was clear, opening pressure 19, no wbc, protein/glucose wnl, crypto negative. toxo negative as well. neuro consulted, considering diagnosis of [**male first name (un) 2326**] virus as cause of pml. eeg showed diffuse encephalopathy but no focal seizure activity. mri showed occipital periventricular t2 flash suggestive of watershed stroke vs. hiv encephalopathy vs. pml. neuro continues to follow. csf cultures pending for hsv, rpr, [**male first name (un) 2326**] virus. now avoiding sedating meds to further eval changes in mental status. patient seems more [**male first name (un) 3584**] and more responsive but still very groggy and difficult to arouse.  patient's mental status gradually improved to be [**male first name (un) 3584**] and oriented x3, back to baseline. . # dropping hct: patient's hct baseline at approximately 25. gradually dropped down to a low of 20, requiring transfusion. later stabilized to 26-27 and not requiring transfusion for several days. likely low at baseline secondary to renal failure, also question of bone marrow suppression from bactrim, underlying hiv. iron studies not helpful in setting of transfusions. patient likely needs epo as outpatient given chronic renal failure. . # hiv: last cd4 150, [**male first name (un) 18617**] load 200k, not on haart currently given history of resistance to anti retrovirals and in setting of acute infection. likely to benefit from haart once over acute illness as outpatient, also in setting of possible cns infection. patient monitored and treated for any associated hiv infections. patient noted to have a few episodes of diarrhea on [**8-16**] likely [**12-27**] to aggressive bowel regimen, c. diff negative. patient followed closely by infectious disease.  haart was held initially and now resumed [**8-28**] on abacavir, lamuvidine, fosamprenavir, ritonavir. . # renal failure: patient with fsgs/hiv nephropathy and baseline cr around 6. renal consult placed a few days after admission and did not recommend dialysis as patient has been making good [**month/day (4) **], nor further worsening of cr. in addition, bactrim may falsely elevate cr. patient treated with ivf, limited diuretics, increased phoslo due to elevated phos, other electrolytes followed closely. patient also with low bicarb down to 15, possibly due to rta, improved with bicarb drip to 22, not requiring further treatment. hyponatremia [**8-28**] with no improvement after 1l ns.  not fluid depleted given no [**month/day (4) **] lytes and euvolemic on exam.  likely siadh given uosm>100, will fluid restrict and monitor na.  improved after fluid restriction of 1500 cc. . # access: left midline placed [**8-29**]. . # comm: with patient, does not have proxy and did not want anyone to be informed of his admission. patient clearly wanted to be intubated during resp distress. required blood in emergency effort to treat dropping hct. lp and ct head done urgently given acute change in ms. . # prophylaxis: sc heparin, ppi, pneumoboots. . # fen: electrolytes monitored and repleted as necessary, ionized calcium low requiring repeated repletion. patient was on tube feeds, held several times for high residuals, treated with reglan during tube feeding and then discontinued. ivf initially with bicarb, i/os even thereafter. patient now taking ample po. bowel regimen. . #

"Chief Complaint:
 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm involving the common iliac arteries.

History of Present Illness:
 this patient is a 65-year-old gentleman with a abdominal aortic aneurysm which on ct scan was found to involve the entire visceral segment of his abdominal aorta, his iliac arteries and extended into the distal portion of the descending thoracic aorta. maximum dimensions of the aneurysm were nearly 8 cm in the abdomen and close to 6 mm in the visceral segment. there were large iliac aneurysms as well. due to the extent of the aneurysm, it was felt that a thoracoabdominal approach using partial right heart bypass was the best way to correct this problem. i might add that ct scan also showed a suggestion of an inflammatory component to the aneurysm in the aorta. prior to the surgery the patient understood the risks of surgeries, especially the potential risk of paraplegia, and agreed to proceed. because of the complex nature of this operation, requiring the expertise of both a vascular and cardiac surgeon, and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, i asked dr. [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) 914**] from cardiac surgery to be my co-surgeon for this procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
 mr. [**known lastname 1924**] is a 65 year-old male who underwent a open thooracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair on [**2163-2-15**].  for details of the operation, please refer to the specific operative note. the cross clamp time was 40 minutes and bypass time was 164 minutes.  he was stable immediately postop, however, remained intubated and sedated due to the length of the operation.  he continued to have good urine output and was awake the following day but remained intubated for diuresis.  it was noted that he was unable to move his bilateral lower extremities but able to follow commands with his upper extremities.  a ct torso as well as mri was performed which showed a t8-conus infarct.  neurology was consulted at that time at if was felt that nothing further could be done for the cord infcartion.  he remained stable and was extubated on [**2163-2-19**] and continued to have good urine output.  he had a increase in his creatinine to a peak of 1.9 then started to decrease to 1.6.  on [**2163-2-20**] was found to be unresponsive in the chair and hypotensive. he underwent cpr, shock and a dose of epinephrine.  he was re-intubated and underwent a ct head which was negative for an acute process at that time.  after the code, he required neosynephrine and levophed for blood pressure support.  he became anuric and renal was consulted and thought it was likely atn.  crrt was initiated on [**2163-2-21**].  he continued to require vasopressor support (neo synephrine and vasopressin).  he had atrial fibrillation rhythm on [**2163-2-22**] and his neo synephrine was changed to levophed.  he was given amiodarone and his atrial fibrillation converted to sinus rhythm.  he grew gnrs from his blood cultures on [**2163-2-20**] and was started on vanco/cefepime. his central lines were re-sited complicated by a right pneumothorax requiring a right chest tube.  a ct torso was performed to assess for a source of his gnrs bacteremia/sepsis and was found to have perforated bowel.  he underwent an exploratory laparatomy on [**2163-2-22**] where a left colectomy was performed for ischemic bowel and his abdomen was left open.  he remained intubated and sedated and he was taken back the following day where his abdomen was washed out and further resection of ischemic rectum was resected.  the following day, a third takeback operation was performed with a transverse colectomy, end colostomy. g-j-tube, and abdominal closure with vicryl mesh was performed.  a vac dressing was placed to his abdominal wound.  please refer to the individual operative notes for further details of the procedure.  he remained ctritically ill on crrt and continued to require vasopressor suuport postoperatively.  it was noted that he had a sudden decrease in his platelet count and a hit antibody was sent which eventually was positive.  his lines were exchanged for non-heparin coated lines and all heparin was stopped.  for prophylaxis, he was started on argatroban on [**2163-2-25**].  a surveillance ct torso was performed on [**2163-3-1**] to evaluate for possible abcesses and it was noted that he had a subcapsular liver hematoma.  the argatroban was discontinued at this time.  he continued to require ventilatory support and eventually underwent a tracheostomy on [**2163-3-4**].  he continued to remain neurologically intact as far as his mental status, however, continued to have no ability to move his bilateral lower extremities.  he further continued to be anuric requiring crrt.  another surveillance ct scan to evaluate the subcapsular hematoma was performed on [**2163-3-28**] which showed enlargement despite no anticoagulation medications.  during the week of [**2154-3-6**] he began to have episodes of bradycardia with hypotension.  he was evaluated by cardiology was an eventual permanent pacemaker was placed on [**2163-3-15**].  he continued to have episodes of bradycardia, with the pacemaker functioning properly to maintain his heart rate. crrt was eventaully stopped and her was transitioned to hemodialysis, tolerating it well.  tubefeeds were started once his ostomy started to function and he was maintained on tube feeds via his j-tube.  infectious disease was initially consulted for his gram negative bacteremia and recommended a prolonged course of antibiotics given his risk on continued infections.  on [**2163-3-17**], his open abdominal wound was sufficiently healed and a split-thickness skin graft was performed.  he tolerated the procedure well and the vac dressing for his skin graft was taken down 5 days afterwards to reveal that much of the skin graft had taken.  at this time, he was deemed stable and a rehab screen was initiated.  a passy-muir valve was fitted for his tracheostomy on [**2163-3-23**].  he remained neurologically stable, able to answer questions appropriately. his blood pressure was stable without the need for vasopressor support and he was able to tolerate trach collar for the majority of the day, requiring ventilatory rest at night.  he continued to tolerate his tube feeds through his j-tube , however, continued to remain oliguric requiring hemodialysis. he has been maintined on

Brief Hospital Course:
 74 yo f with dm2, asthma, pvd, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, multiple non-healing ulcers and sacral decubitus ulcers presenting with fever and hypotension concerning for sepsis. . # hypotension, fevers: originally thought to be multifactorial from hypovolemia (from diarrhea and decreased po intake) as well as possible sepsis from various possible sources including urine, sacral ulcers, heel ulcers, and possible c. diff. she received ivf hydration with good response and did not require pressors. stress dose corticosteroids were started given her medication list of taking methylprednisolone daily. a kub showed no evidence of megacolon.  she was continued on abx therapy with vancomycin iv and po, flagyl, cefepime, and daptomycin after consulting with id as well as stress dose steroids with hydrocortisone.  blood and urine cultures were sent and negative. her leflunomide was held as well out of concern for sepsis. her daptomycin, flagyl, and cefepime were discontinued on [**2149-8-25**], given that she continued to be afebrile with negative cultures. she was continued on po vancomycin, as she continued to have watery stools, while c. diff pcr was pending. the c. diff pcr returned as negative on [**2149-8-27**], and the vancomycin was discontinued. her steroids were tapered as her blood pressures stabilized. . however, the patient continued to have sbps in the 90s-low 100s with low urine output given her gi losses and poor po intake. she also frequently lost iv access. the iv team was unsuccessful in placing a picc line. on [**2149-9-9**], the patient's sbp dropped to the 80s. her iv line inflitrated when attempting to give an iv bolus. iv was unsucessful in placing a new line. pt refused an ej line. despite attempting to encourage po intake, pt's sbp dropped to the 70s and she was transferred back to the micu where a subclavian line was placed. . in the micu: it was felt that her low blood pressure was a result of adrenal insufficiency and volume depletion, or possible sepsis from uti. she was started on hydrocortisone. her blood pressure remained stable after she was bolused with fluids. she was initially started on meropenem and vanco for coverage of her possible uti. her urine culture eventually grew e.coli that was pan-sensitive. she was started on ceftriaxone. her dose of hydrocortisone was lowered prior to transfer to the floor. her statin was held (since she refused po's) and her levothyroxine was changed to iv. . iv steroids were initially continued upon transfer back to medical floor. however, given stable bps and no appreciable improvement in stool output, steroids were tapered to her old home dose. she continued to refuse po the majority of the time with little to no po nitrition. albumin was 1.7 at the lowest; inr became elevated and fibrinogen was quite low, which were thought to be [**1-7**] her poor nutritioal status. she was started on tpn with subesquent normalization in her inr and moderated improvement in albumin to 2.3-2.4. as her condition improved she was able to be restarted on verapimil 80 q8hr (she could not take the long acting for b/c pt refused to swallow pill but would take crushed meds in applesauce). . on the day of discharge she was hemodynamically stable and remained afebrile. . # sacral wounds: the patient has multiple deep ulcers on her buttocks with green purulent drainage.  she was treated with abx as above, and had a wound care consult.  she received morphine for pain control. wound care evaluated the wounds and make dressing recommendations. general surgery was consulted for evaluation of possible debridement. they recommended debridement, but the patient refused bedside debridement on multiple occasions. flexiseal was placed to avoid wound contamination by fecal matter. . # diarrhea: originally thought to be infectious in origin; however, as above, c. diff was negative. she continued to have profuse watery diarrhea, with negative stool cultures. she was initially treated with loperamide, which was then changed to lomotil. the diarrhea worsened when her steroids were being tapered. gi was consulted and felt that given the negative infectious workshop, this was likely a flare of her uc. the patient refused colonoscopy, ct scan, as well as empiric steroids. as noted above, steroids were restarted in the micu during her second stay there for hypostension, but were tapered back down to prior home dose when pressures were stable and stool output was not noticably decreased. initially cmv viral laod had been equivocal, but repeat viral load [**2149-9-16**] was 1,590 copies/ml. she was started on iv gancyclovir. one week into her course, viral load had dreased to 834 copies/ml. she was completed a 2 week course of gancyclovir. however, she continues to have loose, dark brown, guaic + flexiseal output. on [**2149-9-24**], hct dropped to 21.3 and she was started on in pantoprazole and transfused 2 units prbcs. he condition improved. after completion of the gancyclovir course, lomotil was restarted as gi and pt flet that this improved symptoms. . #. agitation, hallucinations: she originally presented to the micu with concern from the vna for altered mental status. she was agitated and screaming on admission to the icu. however, on transfer to the medicine floors she began to improve. her alprazolam and trazodone continued to be held. on [**2149-8-28**] she began to have visual hallucinations and was much more agitated. geriatrics and psychiatry were both involved in her care. in addition to modifying her pain regimen, the patient was started on haloperidol, ultimately 1mg in the morning and 2mg at hs. in the micu, olanizpine was found to be effective. upon retrn to the medical floor, olanzipine was kept as a prn, but was very rarely needed; haldol was d/c'ed. while she remained less aggitated, the patient was still at times confused. given the waxing and [**doctor last name 688**] of the pt's mental status and incapacity to make her own decisions, social work was consulted to help establish guardianship. family was [**name (ni) 653**], but no one was willing to be her guardian. after a meeting between the patient's pcp, [**name10 (nameis) **] primary team, and social work, the decision was made to persue a court-issued gaurdian. after several weeks, a court appointed guardian was established ([**name (ni) **] [**name (ni) 95429**] [**telephone/fax (1) 95430**]) who will help to make key care decisions. . #. [**last name (un) **]: patient was admitted with creatinine of 1.4 thought to be pre-renal secondary to dehydration, that improved with fluid resuscitation. nephrotoxins were avoided. on discharge, her creatinine was back to baseline. . # anemia: her hematocrit was at baseline. normocytic, with iron studies suggestive of anemia of chronic inflammation. she had guaiac positive stools, and her aspirin was held. anemia was stable throughout most of the admission. as noted above, she required transfusion of 2 units on [**2149-9-24**] for an hct of 21.3 but required no further transfusions. . # diabetes: she was initially continued on her home nph with a diabetic diet. however, because of low po intake, the patient had episodes of hypoglycemia, so the decisions as made to hold her nph and cover with humalog sliding scale. patient began to refuse sq insulin, so it was decided to include insulin in her tpn to be adjusted on a daily basis along with heparin. . # hypertension: her blood pressure [**date range 4982**] were originally held given hypotension. when pressures were stable, her verapamil was re-started, but patient took it only intermittently.  as her condition improved she was able to be restarted on verapimil 80 q8hr (she could not take the long acting for b/c pt refused to swallow pill but would take crushed meds in applesauce). . pt was discharged to [**location **] rehabiliation facility for continued care.

[**month/year (2) **] was done on [**11-21**] and showed large amounts of sludge and a sludge ball obstructing flow in the cbd.  sludge ball/stone in cbd is approx 3 cm long, so a 5 cm 10 fr pigtail stent was placed around the sludge ball to facilitate drainage until a definitive procedure can be attempted, now scheduled for [**12-28**].  blood cultures showed g positive rods and clostridium species (not perfringens) in anaerobic culture bottles, but have not yet been speciated.  she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including vanc and zosyn on [**11-22**], then narrowed to zosyn with g negative organisms in blood with plan for 14 day course.  a picc was placed on [**11-28**]. pressors were weaned starting [**11-22**] and she has maintained her bp off pressors. metoprolol was started on [**11-29**] and uptitrated. . # atrial fibrillation with rvr. she developed atrial fibrillation on [**11-23**]. she was initially started on iv amiodarone with no good response. her rate remained in 100-120's, and rate control was initiated with metoprolol and diltiazem on [**11-29**]. on [**11-30**], diltiazem was discontinued and metoprolol was uptitrated. on [**12-1**], she spontaneously converted back to normal sinus rhythm. . # arf: likely related to sepsis (atn), as well as hypovolemia from vomiting and diarrhea. baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4. urine lytes: fena: 0.2, feurea: 14.9%. she was rescuscitated with d5 1/2 ns with 3 amps of bicarb followed by ns prn to maintain cvp > 10.  cr returned to baseline by [**11-26**]. . # anion gap acidosis: most likely related to elevated lactate, initially 4.5 improved consistently with ivf, now 1.7. no history of ingestion and no clear offenders on med list. glucose not c/w dka, bun not c/w uremia. . fen: pt was initially kept npo then provided with full fibersource tube feeds at 30 ml/hr.  in anticipation of extubation and question of whether she would be able to pass speech and swallow immediately, her og tube was changed to an ng tube on [**11-27**].  she was evaluated by speech and swallow and her diet changed to regular full, which she tolerated well. . she was called out of the icu on [**11-30**]. floor course: on the floor, she continued to do well. she spontaneously converted from atrial fibrillation back to nsr on [**12-1**]. her oxygen was weaned, and she was seen by physical therapy, who recommended rehab. the remainder of her blood pressure medications from home were held and should be re-added as an outpatient. she was discharged to rehab on [**12-2**] in stable condition, not on oxygen, and tolerating po. . on the floor, she was noted to have frequent stools (3-4 per day). per her daughter, this is chronic and has been going on for months. a c. difficile study on [**11-27**] was negative, and her abdominal exam is benign. this warrants further workup as an outpatient, and she was instructed to make an appointment to see her primary care doctor as an outpatient once discharged from rehab.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

[**1-23**] nights ago, he had a large meal his mother cooked and had severe diarrhea following this, so he took immodium and increased his narcotics dose. denies any fevers, nausea or vomiting. he was seen by his primary oncologist today who referred him to the ed. ct of the abd/pelvis in the ed confirmed a large amount of stool in the colol with fecalization of the small bowel and ?colitis. was given levo and flagyl in the ed. seen by surgery, who are following with serial abd exams and recommend ivf, npo, and abx.

Brief Hospital Course:
 he initially presented to this hospital on [**2172-10-30**] with severe, [**9-28**] abdominal pain beginning that day, presenting as a ""tight band acoss his abdomen and constipation pain."" ct of the abd/pelvis done on the day of admission confirmed a large amount of stool in the colon with fecalization of the small bowel and ?colitis. the patient given levo and flagyl in the ed. he was seen by surgery, who are following with serial abd exams and recommended ivf, npo, and abx. he was started on zosyn for possible colitis. he was also noted to be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.4 up from a baseline of 1.2. this was thought to be pre-renal and the patient was started on fluids. he had a transaminitis that was stable but his bilirubin was 24 which is up from 22 and alkaline phosphatase that was also significantly elevated. . patient was continued on prophylactic acyclovir. he was continued on voriconazole, started in [**1-25**] for treatment of lung nodules presumed to be fungal. of note galactomannin was negative. the lung nodules have resolved on voriconazole. he is also getting inhaled pentamidine for pcp [**name initial (pre) 1102**]. he was continued on cellcept, solumedrol and cyclosporin as well as photophoresis. . during this admission patient developed progressively worsening lfts and encephalopathy. he has also developed vomiting. an ng tube was placed [**11-1**] with return of 600 cc of brown liquid. imaging was been consistent with a partial small bowel obstruction. patient removed ngt which was complicated by prolonged epistaxis. he was subsequently was found to have a large hematoma in the oropharyx. his hospital stay has been complicated by elevated inr (likely from liver dysfunction) requiring ffp and vitamin k. . due to worsening lfts, patient underwent a liver ultrasound to rule out portal vein thrombosis which showed no thrombosis. patient developed worsening renal failure with urine sodium > 20, thus not consistent with hrs. voriconazole was stopped due to progressive liver failure. liver failure was thought to be due to cyclosporine toxicity vs gvhd. patient underwent photopheresis on [**11-3**]. patient has been guiac positive from above and below. he was seen by id who recommended stopping zosyn due to thrombocytopenia, stopping voriconazole due to liver failure, obtaining ct chest and starting levofloxacin for sbp coverage. liver recommended changing csa to rapamycin and obtaining biopsy. . on the morning of his transfer to the icu the patient was hypertensive to 170/108 and heart rate was 60. he was unresponsive but arousable and disoriented. he underwent head ct to r/o bleed that was negative. sinus ct showed hemorrhage from the nasal cavity to the nasopharynx. ct chest showed worsened consolidation in the right upper lobe with cavitation. temperature later that morning was 95.5. id recommended adding ambisome, meropenem and daptomycin. patient had liver biopsy to evaluate cause of worsening liver function. after returning to the floor the intern was called for sbp of 50. patient was unresponsive. he received blood, saline. repeat bp was elevated at 170/100. emergent us showed liver laceration with venous bleed. patient was transfered to the micu. . in the micu ph was 7.23/27/128/12. lactate was 12. o2 sat was 100% on ra. bp was 120s/60s. hr was 120-130. patient was answering questions appropriately and following commands. patient was given 7 units of prbc, one bag of ffp, 2 bags of platelets, 5 liters of saline, 2 liters of lr and 550 cc of d5w hco3. lactate improved to 3.9 and hematocrit to 43. patient was seen by angiography and they felt bleeding had self tamponaded and wanted to watch overnight. . his micu course was complicated by abdominal compartment syndrome secondary to worsening ascites, ileus, and hemoperitoneum s/p liver bx. surgery was consulted and felt the patient was too high-risk for a surgical decompression. he had a 5 l and 3.5 l paracentesis with some reduction in abdominal pressures. course was also complicated by respiratory failure, secondary to narcotics, increased abdominal pressure, and liver failure. he was intubated while in the icu and attempts to wean towards extubation were unsuccessful. his course was also complicated by liver failure, presumed to be secondary to gvhd and was continued on immunosuppresants with minimal change in lfts. other cx included persistent anemia and thrombocytopenia, thought to be [**1-22**] ttp vs [**doctor first name **] from malignant htn. the plasmapheresis did not seem to help with his platelet count or hematocrit. plasmapheresis was d/c'd on [**11-16**]. because he continued to have severe liver disease from presumably gvhd, he was restarted photopheresis soon. in addition, he was intermittently hypothermic and hemodynamically unstable, requiring pressors. etiology was unclear, and patient was continued on broad-spectrum abx. . given the patient's declining status and worsening prognosis, it was decided that the patient be cpr not indicated by the team and family. aggressive care was continued, including ventilatory support and pressors, however the patient's status declined precipitously despite the efforts of the team, and he expired on [**2172-12-12**].",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
 mr. [**known lastname **] is a 51 yo man with hiv (cd4 of 559 and vl undetectable in [**month (only) 547**]), esrd s/p ddrt in [**2114**], dmi, with 3 prior hospitalizations since [**4-19**] for recurrent rul/rml pneumonia, who presents with hypotension and altered mental status. pt was found to be lethargic and confused by his partner on [**2119-6-13**]. ems was called and his sbp was in the 70s on the field. . he was initially admitted from [**4-19**] to [**4-26**] for right middle lobe pna treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin due to a history of partially treated latent tb. he was discharged and subsequently readmitted on [**5-17**] for fever to 102, hypotension (systolic 70), hypoxia (90% with nrb), and neck stiffness. he was intubated and treated with vancomycin and pressors. he was extubated on [**5-24**] and was treated and monitored for hospital acquired pna, c. diff colitis, and troponin leak. he was discharged on [**6-1**] in good condition. however, pt was readmitted on [**6-3**] with n/v, and inability to tolerate po x 1 day. pt also noted hyperglycemia in the 400s the morning of presentation. he took insulin at home and bg was 150 in the emergency room. pt was thought to have recurrent aspiration pneumonitis and discharged two days later. .

Brief Hospital Course:
 pulmonary: pt was admitted to icu for hypoxia, acidosis, and altered mental status. pulmonary work-up was significant for acidosis on abg on admission. chest ct showed right upper/middle lobe consolidation/atelectasis that appeared consistant with an aspiration event. patient has history over the past three months of waxing and [**doctor last name 688**] infiltrate consistent with reccurant aspiration events. hypersensitivity reaction was in differential and hypersentitivity panel was pending at the time of discharge. patient's rapid resolution of pressor requirement was also in the setting of known automonic instability likely from his longstanding diabetes mellitus. pt was stabilized and transfered to floor. . pt continued to have coughs which improved with time. pt was satting in upper 90s on ra while he was on the floor. it was not certain whether this was non-infectious aspiration pneumonitis vs infectious pna. ct chest showed persistent rml consolidation. given the recurrent nature of pt's sx with periods of resolution in between, it was thought to be likely non-infectious. bcx was negative. pt was taken off of all antibiotics and remained afebrile throughout his hospital stay, with wbc count wnl. pt was noted to have a right sided intrapectoralis fluid collection that was likely due to repeated central line attempts. pt passed swallowing study, although silent aspiration during sleep or during episodes of hypotension could not be excluded. likely scenerio is hypotension leading to somnolence, then aspiration and pulmonary compromise. also in the differential were transplant-associated boop, hypersensitivity pneumonitis. labs for hypersensitivity were pending at the time of discharge. pt was given an acapella device for clearing mucus. pt is to f/u with pulm as outpatient. . altered mental status: patient's mental status rapidly improved with resolution of hyperglycemia and hypotension suggesting it was an issue of metabolic derangement and poor cerebral perfusion. patient had a normal head ct. given the high cd4 count and rapid improvement of mentation, infectious disease did not feel a lumbar puncture was warrented. patient did have an episode of confusion and visual hallucination on the night of [**6-15**], his first night after he was transferred to the floor. he had been given ativan, ambien, amitriptyline together, as he and his partner requested. apparently pt had been taking the three medications at bedtime for many years, although he hadn't taken them in the icu. it was felt that his delirium was due to the medications and possibly due to his new environment on the floor. ambien was discontinued, and ativan was reduced to 0.25-0.5mg at a time. amitriptyline was continued as before. pt did not have another episode of delirium. . fever/leukocytosis: pt had a fever to 100.4 on admission. in the setting of hiv and renal transplant, the initial ddx was wide. pt has had several episodes of similar presentations over the past few months, which were deemed to be of pulmonary origin. ct chest confirmed this dx. he did not have any other evident source of infection. blood cxs and urine cxs were negative. the fevers resolved during the patient's first day of hospitalization and pt remained afebrile through the rest of his hospital stay. . hemodynamic instability: pt was hypotensive to 80s/30s when he arrived in the micu. his hypotension was resonsive to fluids and pressors, which were weaned off during his first evening in the micu. his blood pressure remained labile. all of his usual antihypertensives were discontinued and only metoprolol was begun and titrated up. per dr.[**name (ni) 5907**] (pt's cardiologist) recs, the goal was to titrate up to toprol xl 100 mg daily and varsartan 40 mg daily. pt was discharged on toprol only and pt will discuss adding varsartan when he follows up with dr. [**last name (stitle) **]. . acute renal failure: pt's creatnine bumped to a max of 1.9, with a baseline below 1. he was found to be pre-renal, as evidenced by a fena of 0.5 and hypotension. his cr is returned to baseline quickly. . hyperkalemia: max k 6.7. ekg did not show any changes since prior. it was likely due to pt's renal failure and acidosis. it trended down with fluids, normalization of ph, renal fxn. pt refused kayexelate. . r upper ext swelling: pt complained of r>l upper extremity edema. rue u/s showed old rij clot and new r basilic vein clot. no anticoagulation was indicated at this time, as the old rij had a low risk of dislodging and the new right basilic vein clot was superficial. the primary team consulted [**last name (un) **] endocrine fellow, who did state that diabetic retinopathy is not an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation, although it will increase the risk of retinal hemorrhage. . neuropathic pain: pt stated that he was taking gabapentin 300mg tid, 600 mg qhs, at home, titrating down if pain is less. as gabapentin can have a sedating effect, his dose was decreased with intructions to f/u with pmd. . diarrhea: pt has loose stool/diarrhea at baseline at home and takes tincture of opium 15 drops [**hospital1 **]. he complained of worsening diarrhea while in the hospital (too was not started on admission). pt has h/o + c.diff however most recent stool studies on [**2119-6-14**] were negative. another set of stood studies were sent, which were negative. diarrhea was deemed to be due to diabetic neuropathy, and tincture of opium was started with good effect. . urinary retention: pt c/o urinary retention and had to be straight cathed 2-3 times a day. it was likely due to h/o foley in the icu and diabetic neuropathy. there was no documented history of bph however pt was on flomax at home. pt stated that flomax helped greatly at home, however because of pt's labile bp, finasteride was started instead. pt's partner was shown sterile cath techniques upon discharge and pt was to follow up with a local urologist for evaluation. . dm: pt had very labile bs, with significant hypoglycemia at night. lantus was [**month (only) **]'d to 20 units, and sliding scale was adjusted with smaller doses at bedtime. this fluctuation in bs was likely due to pt's change in diet (ate less than at home). pt was to follow up with an endocrinologist for optimization of insulin regimen. . hiv: stable, haart therapy was continued.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

 hypotension, gi bleeding

History of Present Illness:
 this is a 65 year old man with a history of colon cancer metastatic to lung, liver, abdominal wall, and ureter who presents with n/v, hypotension.  history is obtained from the patient's daughter and from the medical record.  according to the daughter, the patient had been having n/v for several days and she was worried that he was becoming dehydrated.  apparently today he was less alert and had decreased urine output.  his bp at home was 70/40 and he appeared to be having trouble breathing.  he was also having trouble swallowing his pills, due to being more somnolent. . in the ed, vs: 99.9, hr 130s, sbp 60s, o2sat not initially recorded, but per ed resident 70s-80s. he was reportedly unresponsive at that time.  r groin cordis was placed emergently due to inability to obtain bp.  patient was intubated due to concern that he was aspirating on bloody emesis.  ogt placed, immediately post intubation, draining 2500cc dark red blood, which did not clear with lavage.  rectal revealed guaiac + brown stool.  he was started on ivf (5l ns) and levophed and dopamine.  l ij was later placed for additional access.  he was transfused 3u prbc and 2u ffp.  he was also given vitamin k and protamine (to reverse lovenox), as well as protonix iv.  he was given vancomycin and ceftriaxone. . his abdomen was noted to be rigid (in the setting of known extensive mets and gi bleed), so he underwent ct abdomen/pelvis (in addition to cta chest).  he was then transferred to the micu for further management.  gi was also made aware of the patient.

Brief Hospital Course:
 65m with metastatic colon cancer admitted with hypotension, gi bleed, pneumonia, and nstemi. hospital course described below by problems: . 1. hypotension: felt to be primarily secondary to sepsis. possible septic sources included uti and lll pneumonia (seen on chest ct).  blood cultures and bal came back positive for [**first name5 (namepattern1) 564**] [**last name (namepattern1) 563**].  gi bleed was felt to be a less likely etiology as his hct was stable.   possible aspiration event prior to intubation.  there may have also been a component of cardiogenic shock given biventricular dysfunction on tte.  he had no pe on cta.  he received aggressive ivf and blood products without improvement in his blood pressure.  he was started on norepinephrine and vasopressin.  id was consulted for fungemia, and he was treated with caspofungin.  he was also maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics.  bronchoscopy [**4-5**] ruled out endobronchial obstruction.  his antimicrobials and pressors were discontinued when he was made cmo. . 2. gi bleed: possible upper gi bleed given + ngl in ed.  could be related to metastatic disease vs. pud, etc.  gi aware.  egd was deferred as hematocrit was stable and gi bleed was felt unlikely to be the primary issue.  his lovenox was held.  he received vitamin k and ffp to correct coagulopathy.  his hematocrit remained stable.  he was maintained iv ppi [**hospital1 **], which was discontinued when he was made cmo. . 3.  respiratory failure: patient intubated due to concern for mental status, aspiration.  also has pneumonia, underlying pulmonary mets.  the patient was to be continued on ventilation until his mental status and sepsis resolved, though the patient was extubated on [**4-9**] after being made cmo. . 4. arf: creatinine improved to 2.9 from 4.2, baseline 1.1-1.3. most likely pre-renal azotemia due to dehydration +/- atn due to hypotension.  he also received iv contrast for cta, so might expect renal function to worsen further despite aggressive hydration he has received so far.  ct showed known r hydronephrosis and hydroureter, stable. . 5. elevated ces/nstemi: resolving.  ck and tnt initially elevated in setting of hypotension and acute renal failure.  ekg with lateral st depressions, and his trop peaked at 0.99. we could not give asa, plavix, or heparin given gi bleed.  not treated with bb given hypotension. . 6. chf: ef 30% with moderate global lv dysfunction and rv dilatation and severe dysfunction.  no prior studies for comparison. . 7. coagulopathy: patient on lovenox at home. liver function also abnormal, with rising lfts, low albumin - could be contributing as well.  received protamine and ffp in ed, as well as vitamin k.  dic panel negative. . 8. lft abnormalities: improving.  likely related to progression of liver mets as well as component of shock liver in the setting of hypotension.  ruq u/s unremarkable . 9. contrast infiltration into axilla: notified by radiology resident of infiltration of 30cc of ct contrast into axilla. there is some risk of skin necrosis from this, although it was a relatively small amount of contrast.  he was evaluated by plastic surgery who recommended elevation of his arm and monitoring for development of compartment syndrome.  no further intervention was required. . 10. code: he was initially maintained as full code, which was confirmed with daughter (hcp). family meeting on [**4-5**] --> daughter wished to continue aggressive care 24-48hrs; family meeting [**4-7**] --> daughter believed her father's wishes were to have aggressive care and live as long as possible.  the patient's primary oncologist spoke with the family on [**4-9**] and explained the patient's very poor prognosis given his advanced disease, multiorgan system failure, and lack of further oncologic treatment options.  his family decided to make him comfort measures only.  he was extubated and started on morphine drip for comfort.  on the floor the patient was maintained on morphine drip, scopalamine and seen by palliative care.  he was comfortable and passed away without problems.  his family was aware and an autopsy was declined",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Brief Hospital Course:
 impression: 84 y/o jehovah's witness with h/o colon ca, brain ca, dm ii, cad with mi in past, refused angioplasty, and alzheimer's ds presents with stemi s/p cath with cypher stents to lcx, rca complicated by cardiogenic shock with iabp placement with hypotension on pressors, worsening pulm status, now intubated.  her hospital course was complicated by profound anemia, septic shock, cardiovascular and respiratory failure. the patient died on [**2140-7-15**]. 1.  cardiac:  the patient underwent catheterization on [**2140-7-10**] showing a right dominant system with severe three vessel disease. the lmca was angiographically without significant disease. the lad was proximally occluded and was filled by left-to-left and right-to-left collaterals. the mid and distal lad was severely diffusely diseased. the proximal lcx was without flow limiting stenoses and filled a moderate sized om1. the mid lcx was occluded prior to a large om2. the rca was a large dominant vessel with a mid 80% stenosis and a 50% stenosis at the origin of the pl branch. there was a considerable amount of right to left collaterals to the lad. she demonstrated severe pulmonary hypertension (pa mean 47 mmhg). the left and right sided filling presures were severely elevated (ra mean 20 mmhg, rvedp 19 mmhg, pcw mean 37 mmhg). the cardiac output was normal with low systemic resistance (co 6.2 l/min, ci 3.3 l/min/m2). her final cath diagnoses were: 1. three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. severe left and right sided diastolic dysfunction 3. severe pulmonary hypertension. she was placed on iabp post cath, which was weaned 1 day post cath.  as she was hypotensive post procedure, she was started on pressors.  it was not clear the etiology of her hypotension her first night post cath, as her ci was fine, but she was persistently 70s-90s/50s-60s with cool, clammy extremities and peripheral vasodilation.  cardiogenic shock was considered.  she was started on dopamine gtt and maxed out on dosage with persistent map in 40s-50s, then given dobutamine, which was weaned.  as it was then felt she was not likely in cardiogenic shock, she was begun on levophed with good response in her mean arterial pressure (map >60).  at this time, however, she spiked a temperature to 102, was pan cultured, and started on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.  her shock was most likely secondary to sepsis.  a map of >60 was kept during her stay in the unit, supported by pressors and fluid boluses.  as she is a jehovah's witness, she would not accept transfusions of prbcs, so epoetin and ferrous sulfate were begun as adjunctive therapy.  she was also started on aspirin, plavix, a statin, and integrillin gtt for her coronary disease.  despite aggressive measures, the patient acutely decompensated on [**2140-7-15**] in the setting of profound anemia, cardiovascular and respiratory failure, and sepsis. . 2.  septic shock: though the pt had a cardiac index of 3.3 in the cath lab, post-cath the pt seemed peripherally vasodilated.  initially, the pt was afebrile, and it was thought her low systemic vascular resistance was secondary to medications for intubation, however, during the night post-cath, she spiked a temp to 102, and was pan-cultured with blood cx x2 sent, ua and urine cx sent, with endotracheal cx sent.  [all blood cultures during her stay ([**7-10**], [**7-14**], and [**7-15**]) were negative.  all urine cultures sent during her stay ([**7-10**] and [**7-14**]) were negative.  an endotracheal culture from [**7-10**] grew coag positive s. aureus.  a sputum cx from [**2140-7-10**] grew sparse oropharyngeal flora.]  a cxr during the night of her admission to the ccu  demonstrated extensive bilateral perihilar infiltrates involving virtually all segments of the lungs.  she was started empirically on iv vancomycin and iv zosyn for broad coverage (started [**2140-7-11**]) and these meds were continued throughout her stay.  she was begun on pressors to maintain a map of >60.  despite aggressive measures with ivf boluses, pressors, and iv antibiotics, the pt expired [**2140-7-15**], as stated above. . 3.  profound anemia secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding with bloody secretions in et tube after iabp removal.  no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed on abdominal/pelvic ct scans.  it was unclear the precise etiology of the pt's source of bleed.  she developed guiaic positive stool during her stay, and heparin gtt was held.  initially, on arrival to ccu, the pt had bloody secretions in the et tube, which persisted for several days, then resolved.  her health care proxy was notified of her profound anemia, and because she is a jehovah's witness, no tranfusions were given to the patient to correct her anemia. instead, fluid boluses with pressors were given to maintain her map.  iv ferrous sulfate, and epoetin was given to the pt. blood draws were minimized and only necessary labs were obtained. the pt's hct dropped from  36 on [**7-10**] to 20.5 on [**7-11**].  a ct scan of abd/pel did not reveal a retroperitoneal bleed post-cath.  her iabp removal was not complicated by bleeding in excess of normal to explain her acute drop in hct.  on [**7-13**] her hct was 14.7, and had held steady in the 14-16 range for three days.  she developed bloody stools four days post-admission, and gi was consulted.  a nasogastric lavage was performed and was negative.  her hemolytic workup was negative.  her stool was guiaic positive and maroon in color. it was felt she had a lower gi bleed, however she was not stable enough to undergo colonoscopy.  her heparin gtt was discontinued.  her map was supported as stated above.  on the day of her death, her hct was 14.0.  her health care proxy was informed of all events and procedures during her stay, and was given updates as to her hct and measures being taken to support her map. . 4.  respiratory: the pt's cxr was read as ""extensive bilateral perihilar infiltrates involving virtually all segments of the lungs."" post-cath, she was intubated and sedated on mechanical ventilation.  she was unable to be weaned from the vent secondary to hypoxia.  her cxr improved somewhat during her stay, with [**2140-7-12**] cxr showing mild-to-moderate residual pulmonary edema, largely basal, unchanged since [**7-11**], having improved dramatically since [**7-10**], with leftward mediastinal shift reflecting left lower lobe atelectasis, accompanied by persistent small left pleural effusion.  cxr on [**2140-7-15**] demonstrated multiple bilateral asymmetrical areas of hazy opacity, likely from resolving pulmonary edema. her small bilateral effusions and residual lower lobe atelectasis remained.  she remained on broad spectrum iv antibiotics throughout her admission. . 6.  dm type ii:  her blood sugars were well controlled with sliding scale insulin, and fingersticks were checked qid. . # decreased mental status:  a head ct was performed to rule out intracranial bleed as a cause of her depressed mental status and inability to be weaned from the vent (a central cause for respiratory depression/hypoxia was considered) and in the setting of possible systemic hypoperfusion given her septic picture, and was negative for intracranial bleed or mass effect or any acute abnormality.  the pt remained minimally responsive and sedated and intubated throughout her stay. . 7.  seizure d/o no seizures occurred during her admission.  her dilantin level at [**hospital1 **] was 10.6.  we restarted dilantin on admission. . 8.  alzheimer's ds: her aricept was held in light of her critical status. . 9.  depression: her zoloft was held in light of pt's unstable status. she remained intubated and sedated throughout her stay, only minimally responsive on sedation. . 10. code:  full code, although her health care proxy requested at admssion that he wanted to be notified if there was futility/no benefit to further aggressive measures.  the health care proxy was communicated with nearly every day by housestaff physicians, rns in the ccu and the attending physician as to the pt's prognosis, status, and measures being taken in her care. he was involved in all decision making. .",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Brief Hospital Course:
 patient is a [**age over 90 **] year old woman with past medical history of copd, diastolic chf,  orif of left femur fracture complicated by left lower extremity dvt in [**5-/2138**], who was brought in by ambulance from nursing home for hypoxia and hypotension, initially admitted to icu for septic shock, eventually transferred to the floors when hemodynamically stable. hospital course by problem: . # influenza/?pneumonia/sepsis:  patient presented from nursing home in respiratory distress, hypotensive, initially requiring a non-rebreather, and pressor therapy after ivf resuscitation. cxr on admission demonstrated evidence of retrocardiac opacity. per report from nursing home, dfa swab sent just prior to transfer ended up positive for influenza. the patient was treated for influenza with 5 days of tamiflu, and was initially on vancomycin/cefepime for pneumonia, which was converted to levofloxacin to complete a 7 day course. as above, she was started on pressor support on admission due to hypotension/sepsis, also with initial lactate of 2.7, but was quickly weaned off pressors with ivf support with good maintenance of blood pressure.  lactate normalized. as below, the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rvr on admission which was thought to explain her hypotension rather than an infectious sepsis etiology. this was managed as described below. . # acute stroke:  the patient developed acute ms changes early am on [**4-4**], with apparent right sided neglect on exam.  code stroke was called, a ct head (without contrast) was obtained which demonstrated a large left mca territory stroke, embolic. neurology was involved and recommended no tpa given the patient's age and co-morbidity, and recommended no need to check an echo or carotid ultrasound as it would not change management.  she was maintained on a beta blocker for blood pressure control, with iv hydralazine prn to keep sbp < 160.  she was also started on a statin.  neurology followed along during hospital course and felt she likely had a poor prognosis given her age.  the patient remains non-verbal without use of right side. a repeat ct showed evolving area of infarct but no evidence of bleed. a family meeting was held when she was on the general medicine floor (on [**2139-4-10**] with the neurology team, palliative care team, and primary geriatric team to discuss goals of care. the family is still uncertain about goals of care but determined she would not want any invasive procedures (picc, tee, mri, frequent lab draws) at this point. they would like a couple of weeks to observe her progress and reassess her goals of care. she was continued on metoprolol for blood pressure control (with prn hydralazine through the ng tube) and was given lovenox (as opposed to coumadin) for anticoagulation to avoid need for frequent lab draws. if the family decides to pursue a more aggressive management, neuro made the following recommendations: obtain tte and duplex carotids, keep ldl<70, check hga1c, start coumadin and get mri head to evaluate extent of damage. . # cardiac: a. chf:  the patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction, and was on losartan and metoprolol during the hospital course.  in the icu she had had recurrent problems with episodes of hypertension leading to desaturation/wheezing, requiring tight blood pressure and volume status control.  she received iv hydralazine prn, iv lasix to maintain negative fluid balance. losartan was discontinued due to stroke above, and her blood pressure was managed with a goal bp 140-160, and close monitoring of volume status. on the floors she was continued on metoprolol with po hydralazine prn to keep blood pressure within goal range. . b. rhythm:  the patient was initially in atrial fibrillation on presentation (no history of atrial fibrillation per records), then was in normal sinus rhythm during her early hospital course.  she went back in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of acute stroke - at that time, she received dig load in attempt to maintain blood pressure, but she was not continued on dig.  she was maintained on metoprolol, low dose, and spontaneously converted back to normal sinus rhythm within 24 hours.  she was not started on coumadin for fear of converting her large ischemic stroke into a hemorrhagic stroke. once the repeat head ct came back negative for hemorrhage there was discussion of restarting her on coumadin but the family declined as this would require frequent blood sticks for monitoring inr and she had very poor access. she was started on sc lovenox instead. on the floors her rate was well-controlled on metoprolol though for her rhythm she did go in and out of nsr and a-fib. . # uti:  the patient presented as above, and the u/a in ed was positive, though no cultures were sent at that time.  repeat u/a after 24hrs of antibiotics was negative, and culture was negative.  she completed a 7 day course of levofloxacin. . #. respiratory distress overnight on [**4-14**]: the patient triggered for hypoxia and respiratory distress, was felt to be volume overloaded v. aspiration and received 40mg po lasix and 25mg po hydral. she diuresed 3 l and her o2 sat improved from requiring 6lo2 to her baseline 3l o2 requirement. she looked very comfortable the next day w/some crackles on exam so she was given another 40mg po lasix. she subsequently appeared euvolemic and comfortable. she had peg placed given risk for aspiration. she has been on aspiration precautions. i/o should be closely monitored. . rash- the patient developed linear lesions with pustules on r scapula with a few satelite lesions on l. could be pustular zoster though dfa was negative (culture pending). derm was consulted, she was put on zoster precautions and treated with 7 days of acyclovir 500mg 5x/day per ngt for 7 days total (started [**2139-4-13**]), finished today [**4-20**]. please follow up viral culture and monitor clinically for signs of further dissemination (has had none in house).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Brief Hospital Course:
 micu course: in the [**name (ni) **], pt was found to be afebrile. patient had lactate drawn and was 4.4, so she was started on sepsis protocol, and right ij was placed.  she received 3 litres intravenous normal saline, and subsequent lactate improved to 1.4.  patient was given ceftriaxone/azithromycin for possible infiltrate on chest x-ray concerning for pneumonia, after blood cultures x 3 and urine cultures were sent.  pt found to have uti. given her hiv history, she was also given treatment dose loading of tmp/smx. to both fungal and uti coverage.  further, given concern for possible endocarditis, vancomycin and gentamicin were started. pt had tte which did not show a vegetation on her valves.  given negative [**location (un) **] criteria pt no longer needed coverage for endocarditis. pt was switched ot unasyn and azithromycin. pt also had concern for tb so pt placed on isolation and 3 sputum cultures were ordered. given pts extensive polysubstance abuse, she had tox screens done. she had a positive urine cocaine screen. there was concern for drug withdrawal. pt also had 2 code purples due to agitated violent behavior. pt was found to have 2 crack pipes and a spring loaded knife in her possesion. pt started on 1:1 sitter. psych evaluated and she was placed on standing ativan and haldol. in addition, pt was noted to have multiple rashes on extremities. derm was consulted. [**first name8 (namepattern2) 6**] [**doctor first name **] was positive. further workup for rheumatologic disorders begun.  additionally she was treated for sebborheic dermatitis and psoriasis. pt had complained of bilateral eye pain and was seen by optho who felt that her pain may be secondary to old stable corneal scars. she was started on lubricant drops. . [**hospital ward name 121**] 3 course: pt was transferred to the floor on [**8-31**], and immediately triggered a code purple before even being seen, and triggered 2 more that evening, appearing very anxious.  overnight pt was managed somewhat with ativan and haldol, but in the am started setting off code purples again.  a review of her chart revealed that she had not been on methadone as she stated she was on for maintainance therapy.  she [**doctor last name 8196**] admitted she gets methadone, 10mg a day, from a friend of hers that has low back pain.  she has been taking this for at least 3 years.  at that time, on [**9-1**] pt was started on methadone 10mg a day and after that point did not cause another code purple. from an infectious standpoint pt improved qiuckly and did not have a cough at all on the floor, remained afebrile and without an elevated white count.  the thinking was that the infection most likely was an atypical pneumonia.  on [**9-2**] pt was swtiched from unasyn to augmentin (in addition to azithromycin). on [**9-3**] am, her third tb smear returned negative and pt was taking off isolation precautions.  upon dischrge id's recommendation was to complete therapy for pneumonia (aspiration vs. cap) with a course of augmentin for 10-14 days. pt was sent out on a 4 day course of abx for a total of 10 days. on [**9-1**] pt was noticed to have an elevated potassium to 5.2. this lab was thought to be due to hemolysis but the following day the k came back at 5.5, recheck at 5.5 in the pm.  this was thought to be possibly a drug related effect due to tmp-smx although unlikely given long-term use.  per id it may have been due to unasyn which was d/c'd that morning.  tmp-smx was also decreased to normal strenght.  renal insufficiency is another possibility given that bun was uptrending and creatinine was 1.0 which is a little bit high given her size.  she was promoted to take in oral ingestion of fluids, recheck unchanged.  the following am the labs were reassuring, and included k 4.9, bun 23 (stable), creat (1.1). pt's rashes remained stable and improved slowly on the floor. rheum labs were still pending at discharge.  i would encourage pcp [**name initial (pre) **]/or derm to follow-up on these do decide if need further work-up, treatment or a rheum consult. she had no further eye pain. the plan for discharge was for the patient to go to the women's hope program, but the bed fell through at the last minute; therefore pt was instructed to call the women's hope program after discharge to schedule a bed.  this was discussed with the social worker and care management for substance abuse treatment. pt was scheduled appointments with her pcp for hiv treatment and follow-up as well as for her methadone maintainance for previous ivdu.  pt was given 2 days worth of methadone and klonopin as she had been on these drugs long term.  i strongy recommended against continued use of a benzodiazipine such as klonopin and encouraged a discussion with pt's pcp regarding the need for methadone maintainance preferrable with a methadone [**hospital 8197**] clinic.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Brief Hospital Course:
 57m w/ chronic hepatitis c cirrhosis on the liver transplant list, undergoing outpatient hcv eradication treatment with interferon/ribavirin/telapivir now p/w profound weakness and clinic labs concerning for worsening liver and kidney function, found to have klebsiella urosepsis with good resolution on iv antibiotics. . #septic shock. pt presented with profound weakness but stable vs, no hypotension or decrease in urine output, no fever or tachycardia. wbc was elevated to 14. in this context, lab abnormalities showing thrombocytopenia, anemia and [**last name (un) **] were most concerning for possible adverse effect of recently-initiated telapivir therapy. patient was very ill-appearing on initial exam, but given strong concern for drug effect, unremarkable ua, and cxr without e/o pna, no empiric antibiotics were started. blood cultures were sent with admission labs. late on hd1, patient spiked a fever to 101, developed worsening mental status (only oriented to self), and sbp 80s (baseline 1wk prior was 110s). patient received 2l ns w/o change in bp. given concern for infection, patient was started on ceftriaxone and flagyl, which was shortly thereafter broadened to vanco and zosyn. given potential for rapid patient decompensation as well as concern regarding available nursing resources, patient was transferred to the icu for further management. . in the icu, non-invasive bp were [**location (un) 1131**] as low as 50. an a-line was placed for more accurate bp monitoring. initially, pressures were 80s-90s on the a-line, but dropped to the 70s. peripheral dopamine was started and a right ij cvl was placed and pressors were changed to norepi. abx were continued, and bcx from the floor grew out gram negative rods. renal and liver both recommended albumin for volume resuscitation. mental status improved with improvement in blood pressures.  pressures improved and pt was weaned off pressors and returned to the floor for further care. . after floor transfer, urine and blood cultures grew out pan-sensitive klebsiella, so antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone. the patient continued to improve significantly each day, such that on hospital day 5 he was able to sit up in bed, converse easily, and passed physical therapy evaluation to be able to get out of bed without assistance to the bathroom. he was noted to still have [**3-25**] residual weakness in all 4 extremities, which may benefit from rehabilitation. he has a picc and will continue to receive ceftriaxone iv for a 2-week course, last day [**2121-8-17**]. . # hcv cirrhosis/esld on antiviral therapy. pt has end-stage liver disease with chronically elevated lfts, inr, and thrombocytopenia. genotype i hcv has been resistant to previous rounds of interferon therapy. prior to this admission patient was doing well, and, given his transplant listing, was started on outpatient viral eradication therapy with interferon, ribavirin and telapivir. these medications may explain for some of the anemia, thrombocytopenia, and chronic weakness the patient experienced even prior to his recent acute decline in the 4-5 days prior to admission, and may have left him susceptible to infection. indeed, per outpatient records telapavir was started earlier than had been planned because the patient already showed worsening thrombocytopenia on interferon/ribavirin. all antiviral medications were stopped by his outpatient hepatologist immediately prior to admission, and were held in the hospital too. meld was 30 on admission, 22 by hospital day 5 as labs improved; this laboratory improvement mirrored clinical improvement. hcv titer 150 on admission, lfts elevated on admission but trending down prior to discharge. . # acute kidney injury. pt presented with elevated creatine which was concerning for kidney hypoperfusion versus hepatorenal syndrome, in the context of worsening lfts and elevated tbili. thought to be pre-renal, most likely from sepsis. maximum creatinine was simultaneous with fever and hypotension onset, 2.9, trending down thereafter. normal renal us. he received iv fluid resuscitation with albumin in the icu, but maintained normal bp without fluids after floor transfer. also taking good pos and making urine well. . #altered mental status patient was aox3 but had difficulty communicating and had declining mental status on the evening of admission. improved markedly with antibiotic therapy. family provided history of possible falls at home prior to admission; head ct was without evidence of trauma or bleed. when alert, patient was able to clarify history of falls - he felt legs becoming weak and lowered himself to the ground, no loss of consciousness and no head strike. he was maintained on home lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy prophylaxis. . # macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia. ddx for anemia was broad in this patient: red cell underproduction, bleeding, consumption all possibe. in our patient anemia likely secondary to baseline liver/kidney destruction as well as ribavirin-induced hemolysis.  patient has had gradual drop in hct since [**5-31**], roughly around the time that hcv treatment was initiated. hemolysis is known side effect of ribavirin. the more acute drop in recent weeks likely reflects patient's concurrent renal impairment as renal excretion of ribavirin, so any renal impairment will increase serum levels (particularly within erythrocytes). as the usual half life of ribavirin is 120 days, the presence of renal failure promotes severe ongoing haemolysis. patient received 1 blood transfusion of 1u prbc for a hct 20.6, with resultant rise of hct to only 22.6. he also received 1u prbc on the day of discharge, for a hct of 20.8;

Brief Hospital Course:
 # shock: pt had septic physiology on admission to the ccu, and the most likely source was felt to be postobstructive pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion. his ci was high, so his hypotension was not felt to be due to cardiogenic shock. he was initially maintained on 3 pressors upon transfer to the micu service, but neosynephrine was weaned off quickly. he was given empiric zosyn and vancomycin to cover polymicrobial sepsis. levophed was gradually weaned the next day, and then vasopressin was stopped. levophed had to be restarted for a few hours on [**9-19**] for map<60, but it was weaned off the next day. . # respiratory failure: pt was intubated during his first pea arrest. the r-sided chest tube initially drained a large volume of mucinous fluid, then drained serosanguinous fluid. the fluid was grossly exudative with ldh 4000 on a diluted specimen. the pleural fluid amylase was also elevated, to 3x the serum value. the gram stain was negative, and cultures are no growth to date. his noncontrast chest ct showed a rll rounded opacity with no air bronchograms but density consistent with lung parenchyma. the differential was thought to include atelectasis vs. postobstructive pneumonia vs. sequestration. he underwent a bronchoscopy on [**9-18**] with mild secretions and no endobronchial lesions visualized, and a bal was sent. his ventilatory requirements were gradually weaned, however he had trouble ventilating adequately while on pressure support. ct chest with contrast showed the rll opacity was a large mass with significant surrounding lymphadenopathy and marked pleural tumor, with possible invasion into the chest wall. pleural fluid cytology returned suspicious for adenocarcinoma, and pt was ultimately diagnosed with stage iiia lung cancer.  pt's progressive respiratory failure was treated with bipap and nebs, but he continually removed his bipap, leading to significantly labored breathing and desaturation.  a family meeting concluded that bipap should be deferred, and that pt should be made dnr/dni with a focus on full comfort measures.  pt ultimately died of respiratory failure likely due to a combination of copd, pneumonia and lung cancer on the morning of [**2191-10-3**]. . # altered mental status: she had a subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage on ct. neurosurgery was consulted, and felt that the bleed was likely an effect of reperfusion during arrest. he had leukocytosis but no fever, and no history of headache at home, so meningitis was thought to be unlikely and lp was deferred. tox screen was negative on admission. he was able to follow commands and communicate effectively when his sedation was weaned.  pt maintained a waxing-[**doctor last name 688**] course until his death on [**2191-10-3**]. . # arf: it was thought likely secondary to hypoperfusion/atn in the setting of cardiac arrest and shock. his creatinine gradually improved to normal. . # ugib: his og tube initially drained clots on admission. he was felt to have an upper gi bleed in the setting of heparin and integrilin in the cath lab, and it was self-resolved. upon transfer to the micu, his og tube was draining a thick white chylous-appearing fluid. that also resolved spontaneously. his ct was reviewed by radiology who stated there was no evidence of esophageal perforation. he was maintained on an iv ppi [**hospital1 **], and his hct remained stable for the remainder of his course. . pt was maintained on full comfort measures once a family meeting concluded that he sould be made dnr/dni w/o further aggressive management of his progressive respiratory failure.  on the morning of [**2191-10-3**], pt died a peaceful death due to complications of progressive respiratory failure, likely secondary to lung cancer, pneumonia, copd and an expanding malignant pleural effusion.  pt's family was notified, and they deferred autopsy.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Brief Hospital Course:
 primary reason for hospitalization: mr. [**known lastname 28445**] is a 75 year old man with history of panhypopituitarism and suspected pituitary lesion status post undiagnostic transphenoidal biopsy who presented with sepsis due to biliary obstruction from mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  patient recieved a percutaneous biliary drain and underwent a laparoscopic lymph node biopsy, results show diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl).  he underwent therapy with r-chop. . active problems by issue: # dlbcl: fna provided differential of dlbcl, follicular, or burkitt's.  laparoscopic excisional ln biopsy definitively characterize as diffuse large b-cell lymphoma.  tte for baseline cardiac assessment was grossly normal with ef>55% and no valvular abnormalities or focal hypokinesis.  lp was performed; cytology of csf shows no malignant cells.  flow cytometry of csf shows negative for malignant cells.  e was kept in the hospital for to assess need for cns treatment for lymphoma as well given his pituitary problems below, however, it was finally decided that the pituitary is not due to lymphoma.  tls labs were checked twice a day and the patient was continued on acyclovir prophylaxis and provided with caphosol mouth care.  he did not develop complications of the r-chop protocol.  he will have his continued care through dr. [**first name (stitle) **] in [**hospital3 **].  he should take filgrastim at home in between chemotherapy treatments. . # sepsis/cholangitis: patient had cholangitis secondary to biliary obstruction from large mesenteric lymphadenopathy. percutaneous biliary drain and biliary stent were placed during last hospitalization and capped prior to that discharge; perc drain was revised after patient presented again in sepsis. blood cultures drawn during sepsis grew pansensitve klebsiella, and he completed a 14 day course of piperacillin/tazobactam. patient's lfts normalized and when the biliary drain did not drain anything in 24 hrs, it was capped.  unfortunately, once he became neutropenic, he again developed sepsis and a cholangitis picture with right upper quadrant pain and elevated liver enzymes especially alkaline phosphatase.  the drain was uncapped and 650 cc of cloudy fluid was drained with immediate relief of pain, recovery of blood pressure, and resolution of fever.  he was treated with cefepime/flagyl and then stepped down to cipro/flagyl by mouth for 14 days upon discharge.  the biliary drain was exchanged for a different type by interventional radiology after the 2nd episode of sepsis.  interventional radiology recommended that the drain remain in place for 3 months until the lymphadenopathy has shrunk enough for the biliary system to stay open without the drain.  they will see him in clinic to schedule removal. . # hypernatremia: patient was hypernatremic several times in the setting of high serum osm and low urine osm.  patient was diagnosed with central di shown by ddavp test where he had 3x concentration of urine osm after ddavp prior to admission.  he was maintained for several days on desmopressin 0.05 mg once at night with normal serum sodium levels.  upon discharge he was set up with a vna to draw daily sodium levels and fax them to an endocrinologist, dr. [**first name (stitle) 4160**].  if his na is greater than 143, he is to take an additional 0.05 mg ddavp. . #guaiac positive stool.  patient had some guiac positive stools during admission and some diarrhea.  he was consistently negative for c. diff infection and it was thought that his diarrhea was due to the cathartic effect of blood.  mcv also trended down this hospitalization, more indicative of active bleeding leading to iron deficiency.  the most likely explanation for his intermittent guiac positive stools was small bleeding from his perc drain.  his hematocrit remained stable during admission and he was hemodynamically stable.  he was told that his black stools should resolve and if they do not, he should report to his pcp. . # pituitary mass/panhypopituitarism:  obtained [**hospital1 3278**] records which showed patient was found to be panhypopit after presenting in severe malaise.  was started on hydrocortisone by [**hospital3 **] endocrinologist and levothyroxine.  then, presented with diplopia and was found to have unilateral 6th nerve palsy.  mri brain showed abnormal enhancement of pituitary infundibulum. received transphenoidal biopsy, which showed normal bone in clivus and normal brain tissue in pituitary, no tumor cells.  mr brain this admission shows normal size and shape of pituitary; evidence of prior biopsy/surgery; no evidence of cns lymphoma. fsh, lh, testosterone very low.  total t4 ok (on replacement), but very low tsh on replacement levothyroxine.  patient also was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus by endocrinology this admission (see below).  he was discharged on prednisone 10 mg daily to support his adrenal function and his levothyroxine was increased to 100 daily due to constipation and 4 low-normal.  it was decided by the neuro-oncolgy tumor board that without evidence of cns lymphoma by mri, biopsy, and 2 lps it was unlikely that he had a lymphoma causing panhypopit.  he should have a repeat mri in [**4-13**] weeks and follow-up with dr. [**last name (stitle) 6570**] (neuro-oncologist) to make sure no tumor appears. . #hypercalcemia: corrected ca [**87**].9 at highest.  differential diagnosis included granulomatous dz conversion of 25vitd to 1,25vitd, paraneoplastic syndrome or bone mets (but no evidence of such on imaging).  pth low, so not primary hyperparathyroidism.  paraneoplastic syndrome was not likely since pthrp was 26, within reference range.  25-oh vitd was normal and 1,25-oh vitd was low, which is not consistent with increased conversion from lymphoma/granulomatous dz. lymphoma is not a common producer of pthrp, but could produce il-6 which stimulates osteoclastic activity.  still no clear etiology of hypercalcemia.  hypercalcemia resolved with iv hydration for hypernatremia. . # acute kidney injury ([**last name (un) **]): patient's cr was initially elevated to 1.5, likely mixed atn/pre-renal process as patient was septic.  fena > 1% suggesting atn.  urine sediment was bland. he was aggressively volume repleted in icu and cr normalized(baseline 1.0).  it was not felt that tumor lysis syndrome was contributing to this because he had a normal uric acid and ldh.  renal us showed no tumor involvement causing obstruction. . chronic problems by issue: . # hypertension (htn): patient was hypotensive in the icu when coming out of a septic picture.  he was restarted on his home lisinopril, amlodipine, and metoprolol one at a time.  at discharge, he was normotensive on his previous home regimen. . #urethral bleeding:  patient was catheterized early on transfer to the floor for ddavp test and started to have mild urethral bleeding.  it was getting progressively worse, eventually turning into gross bleeding from urethra after urination. bleeding stopped with holding pressure.  urology consultants felt this was likely foley trauma and after 3-5days it healed without intervention. . # pulmonary nodules:  patient had ct chest that showed diffuse and partly clustered micronodules with tree-in-[**male first name (un) 239**] distribution, as well as airway wall thickening and mild irregularities. unclear if this is infectious, inflammatory or malignant process. pulmonary consult believes it is a result of severe pneumonia patient states he had many decades ago. . # gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd): continued on home omeprazole. . # benign prostatic hypertrophy (bph): continued on home finasteride 5mg daily. . transitional issues: - please ensure that he continues to stay on schedule with r-chop cycles (cycle 1 completed during this admission) for his dlbcl.  he can have these at cape code hospital with dr. [**first name (stitle) **] but he should not miss any cycles if he is able to tolerate them medically - please ensure that he maintains his prednisone between 7.5 and 10 mg daily to ensure adrenal support - please monitor his serum sodium daily for the next 2 weeks. he has central diabetes insipidus and will dose his ddavp per phone recommendations from endocrinology.  he has been stable on desmopressin 0.05 mg po at night - please check hematocrit, calcium, and creatinine at follow-up to ensure that these are remaining normal - he should have a repeat mri in [**4-13**] weeks and follow-up with dr.

(at baseline the patient is reported to have expressive aphasia with right facial droop). the patient has been admitted multiple times previously with similar symptoms of lethargy which has been secondary to recurrent uti. the patient on admission was not noted to have fevers/chills or abdominal pain. on admission from the ed the patient was with vitals as follows: t 99.2; bp 140/73; hr 73; o2 sat 100%ra. while in the ed the patient dropped his pressure as low as 73/37 with improvement after fluids.      [**hospital unit name 153**] course: in the icu the patient was initiated on therapy with broad spectrum coverage with zosyn and vanc. microbiology review reveals the patient has had recurrent infection with e. coli, morganella morganii, group b strep, and enterococcus. the dominant organism has been e. coli which has been quinolone resistant, zosyn undeterminate (although most recent report states sensitive), sensitive to cefepime, ceftriaxone. urology was consulted with impression that the patient is not an operative candidate for his bladder diverticulum given his medical co morbidities. a ct head revealed no acute pathology, the patient was ruled out for mi and impression is that patient's agitation and delirium is from his underlying infection. the patient on admission to the icu was noted to have somnolence alternating with agitation consistent with delirium for which he received intermittent doses of haldol.    during the icu course the patient's antihypertensives were held given concern for possible urosepsis as patient had low bp on arrival. the patient's bp is reported to have recovered with fluid, did not require repeated boluses or pressors for pressure maintenance. additional review of micro data reveals that the patient had [**12-21**] blood cultures positive for enterococcus from the ed although icu note reports 1/4 bottles positive with impression of skin contaminant. he initially received broad spectrum treatment with vancomycin & zosyn. this was narrowed down to ampicillin. the patient will require 14 day course iv antibiotics for complicated uti, picc placed, he will finish treatment on [**2100-10-23**]. nitrofurantoin for suppressive tx should be resumed later. he had tte without vegetation in ed (performed for different indication), risk/benefit in this patient does not favor tee.     dysphagia with signs of aspiration were noted. we recommended peg tube placement, however they decided not to have it placed. the son understands that his father will not meet his nutritional needs and hydration needs with potential developement of dehydration, hypotension, and hypernatremia. they will reconsider it again if has difficulties at the nursing home. chem7 should be checked at the nursing home to prevent the developement of hypernatremia. we stopped his lasix and some of his antihypertensive medications because of low bp.      sacral decubitus ulcer: stage ii on wound care to be continued at the nursing home.      malnutrition, moderate - patient not taking reliable po, albumin 2.2.      code - full - confirmed with patient's son who is his healthcare proxy and poa - son [**name (ni) **]: cell [**telephone/fax (1) 22234**]. . . . total discharge time 87 minutes. . . . . .",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 patient is a 68 yo f, h/o cervical ca, radiation cystitis, radiation colitis, frequent line infections, recurrent utis who presented after developing acute on chronic severe abdominal pain. four days prior to admission, patient woke with severe abdominal pain that was worsened with movement. she had some dysuria in the days prior. she also complained of nausea and vomiting. her abdominal pain was worsened by movement. she denied fevers or chills. . she was brought by ambulance to an outside hospital. there she had a ct of her abdomen which was notable for mild ascites, but no acute process. she was mildly hypotensive to sbp of 90s and was given 3 l ns. given levofloxacin/flagyl. she was transferred to the [**hospital1 18**] ed. on arrival t 100.8, hr 107, bp 100/71. soon thereafter sbp dropped to the 70s and she was bolused a total 5l ns. her ostomy output was heme negative. u/a showed gross blood and + wbc. she was given one dose of meropenem 500mg iv, as this is what she was discharged on previously. her pain was also treated with tylenol and dilaudid. she became mildly hypotensive with dilaudid. pt was then transfer to the micu her vs were t 98, 120/51, 15, 99/ra. . on arrival to the icu, she again become hypotensive and required levophed. she also recieved one unit of prbcs for hct of 22. she was continued on meropenem for presumed urosepsis, and had received a total of 8l of iv fluids while in the icu.  she was then transferred to the floor after she stabilized on [**3-13**]. . the morning of [**3-14**], she was noted to be in marked respiratory distress.  her oxygen saturation at times dropped to 80% on non-rebreather, and was noted to be hypertensive into the 160s systolic.  she was given 20mg lasix x 2, her usual dose of dilaudid and hydralazine without marked improvement, and the micu resident was called.  examination demonstrated bilateral crackles and jvp elevated to the angle of the mandible.  cxr demonstrated marked pulmonary edema.  she was given nitroglycerin sl and transferred to the icu for possible initiation of bipap. . when she arrived in the icu, her respiratory status had markedly improved and she denied any shortness of breath or chest pain. she continued however to have abdominal pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
 micu course: [**date range (1) 70244**] # sepsis of likely urinary origin: upon presentation to [**hospital1 18**] on [**3-11**], had blood pressure drop to 70s sytolic. she was given 5l ivf in ed and transferred to micu. cxr was unrevealing. u/a showed increased leuks and wbc on urine micro. was empirically started on meropenem in micu given that patient had recently been on carbapenems for a uti in end of 1/[**2126**]. in micu her bp was intially stable and then fell and patient was started on norepinephrine, which she remained on for approximately 17 hours on [**3-12**]. given patient's severe abdominal pain, received a ct abd/pelvis in the ed which showed moderate ascites, though no other acute changes. surgery consult was called and felt that there was no acute surgical intervention indicated and followed the patient's course in the micu. we also trended patient's lactate level, which was 3.2 at presentation and trended down to 1.3 with fluid resuscitation. checked cdiff toxin, which was negative. iv team was called to assist in managment of patient's tunneled double lumen catheter and they suggested ethanol dwells between tpn infusions in order to prevent line infection. blood cultures from [**3-11**] and [**3-12**] were negative. . # abdominal pain: pain with severe abdominal pain upon presentation. we reassured after ruling out acute intra-abdominal process with ct scan and serial exams. given frequent (q1hour) iv dilaudid requirements on morning of [**3-13**], pain service consult was called; however, prior to pain service seeing patient her pain improved to point that dilaudid could be given less frequently. was felt that we had been behind on pain control after sleeping overnight, possible due to held doses of gabapentin. she was continued on methadone, dilaudid, and gabapentin. . # anemia: hct was found to be 22, pt was transfused 1 unit of prbcs. post-transfusion hct was 26.9. . medicine floor course: [**date range (1) 32116**]: patient was called out from the micu on [**2126-3-13**] after she had been normotensive for 24 hours without pressors. she had a new oxygen requirement (94% on 4l) thought [**2-20**] volume overload (8 l + for los). overnight, she was hypertensive to 188/80. in the morning she was found to be hypoxic to 81% on 4l. she was put on a non-rebreather with intermittent improvement of her oxygen sats to low 90s but would then drop to low 80s. she was also given iv lasix 20 mg x 2 and she put out 2 l in 2 hours. her blood pressure was treated with hydralazine 20 mg iv x1 and sl nitro. despite these interventions she was still hypoxic in the 80s on a non-rebreather and was transferred back to the micu for positive pressure ventilation and aggressive diuresis. . micu course: [**date range (1) 97780**]: cxr was c/w volume overload, likely from fluid resuscitation she received in the micu. she was diuresed with iv lasix and started on azithromycin for atypical pneumonia coverage. ct chest performed later revealed extensive fibrotic changes and ground-glass opacities suggestive of pneumonitis such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug toxicity, or nsip. pneumonitis workup was initiated. esr =83, crp = 188.2, [**doctor first name **], anca, beta-glucan, and galactomannan were all negative. she was stable and was transferred to the floor for further evaluation.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Brief Hospital Course:
 1) cirrhosis/sbp: mr. [**known lastname **] was started on ceftriaxone 2gm iv q24h for osh paracentesis results consistent with sbp. initial labs confirmed a hemolytic anemia, with haptoglobin <20, and a dic-like process, with low fibrinogen, elevated fdp, and schistocytes on peripheral smear. he also had very poor urine output, producing only 80ml during his first 24h in-house, with a fena<1%, consisent with prerenal or hepatorenal syndrome. he was initially treated with ffp and prbc to keep his inr around 2.5 and his hct around 25. he was also treated with albumin, per sbp protocol, and to provide volume.  ascites cultures from [**hospital 13548**]hospital did not have any bacterial growth. on day #2 of his stay. mr. [**known lastname **] grew increasingly dyspneic with worsening ascites. cxr revealed only small pleural effusions, but decreased lung volumes, believed to be compressed by his ascites. his uop had increased somewhat, and a decision was made to avoid a paracentesis, due to bleeding risk. his uop increased, ascites remained stable, and his sob resolved somewhat. he did not become encephalopathic, and was a&ox3 throughout his course. a f/u diagnostic paracentesis was done on day #3 of his stay, which did not meet criteria for sbp, and his previous antibiotic course was completed. transplant surgery was consulted and, when mr. [**known lastname **] condition had stabilized over the next 24-48h, efforts were made to facilitate an expidited liver transplant work-up. he was ordered for a tte, pfts, a social work consult, and an mri/mra with volumetrics. his nadalol was held during his acute illness period. also of note, the egd at osh showed grade i varices. . 2. hepatorenal: the pt was noted to have a creatinine of 2.2 on admission, and his baseline was 1.4 previously and possibly lower since there was only one previous measurement available on record. his clinical and laboratory picture was most consistent with hepatorenal syndrome, with a highly sodium avid state demonstrated in the urine lytes. he was given daily infusions of albumin along with octreotide and midodrine with good effect, since his creatinine trended down to 1.8 over the next several days. however for unknown reasons the renal function later deteriorated again, trending up to 4.5. during this episode of worsening, renal consult was called. the renal team agreed persued a renewed work-up and ultimately agreed with the diagnosis of hepatorenal sydrome. albumin infusions, octreotide, and midodrine were continued. after several days, there was again signs of improvement in the renal function. the patient never required dialysis. his renal function had no completely stabilized yet he wanted to leave the hospital and left ama. . 3. volume overload: on a couple of separate occasions during the hospitalization, the patient was noted be volume overloaded. as noted above, the renal function fluctuated and at points there was required albumin infusions to treat hepatorenal while the kidneys were failing and unable to clear the volume.  the patient did develop symptoms of sob and chf on cxr, as well as an elevated bnp level to 41,000. although he was never progressed past the point of feeling mild symptoms of sob. because of his history and echocardiographic findings of normal cardiac function, the etiology of the overload was assessed as a problem of clearing volume from kidneys with the added stress of massive volume with daily 50g of albumin as well as 3u prbcs over a couple of weeks. his volume status was followed clinically. renal was following as well in case of the need for dialysis if acutely overloaded, although this was avoided. . 3. anemia: the hct remained 25 range and stable during the admission. there was a question that the patient did not seem to be responding to tranfusions. the blood bank was [**name (ni) 653**], though it is unclear whether the pt is truly rbc transfusion resistant at this time. . 4. diarrhea: mr. [**known lastname **] had recently completed most of a 15-day course of flagyl for c. diff colitis. he continued to have [**6-3**] watery stools per day, and was treated empirically with flagyl. c. diff was negative and toxin b was sent which was similarly negative. he did continue to receive flagyl while on treatment doses of the ciprofloxacin.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

afib vs. aflutter.  hrs in 120s-140s during these epsisodes. low bps but had normal perfusion.  electrophysiologists were consulted and started 4 week amiodarone load with 400 mg daily. then will start 200 mg amiodarone daily indefinitely.  also on digoxin 0.125 mg every other day.  pt was not on beta blocker during this time because blood pressure were unable to tolerate.  while on floor, after approx 1-1.5 weeks of amio load, patient's aflutter/fib resolved.  was in nsr and telemetry was discontinued.  she was noted to have several runs of asymptomatic nsvt to about 10 beats while on telemetry.  will continue amio 400 mg until [**7-10**], then switch to 200 mg daily. . # encephalopathy - likely related to toxic metabolite buildup, probably hepatic failure is biggest contributor.  would wax and wane between confusion and lucidness.  would treat aggitation with sl zyprexa.  avoided sedating meds.  pt was refusing narcotics for pain control because she could feel herself not thinking clearly.  upon discharge, patient has appropriate mental status for several days and was able to understand her situation.  likely has depression contributing at some level, too.  often is sad and crying in the morning when family is not around. . # hypoglycemia: pt has history of diabetes, but is no longer on any diabetic meds because of these low blood sugars.  is likely due to poor nutritional stores in setting of hepatic failure with poor gluconeogenesis.  endocrinology was consulted during previous admission and did not feel insulinoma was a possibility.  c peptide was likely only elevated because it is renally cleared.  pt fs was as low as 15 while in the micu.  pt was able to resume her diet and then have appropriate blood sugars.  she does need encouragement to keep appropriate po intake.  while on the general medicine floor, had a period ofo altered mental status in which she was too somnolent to eat, and to maintain sugars, we had her on a d10w gtt at 500cc/hr for about 3 days.  she became hyponatremic at that time.  her mental status improved, we were able to stop the drip and keep her on her normal po diet and her sugars did much better.  her hyponatremia also resolved.  we started her on scheduled glucose tabs, but she does not take them regularly because she does not like the taste. . # esrd/hd: on hd mwf.  needs to continue this schedule as an outpatient. . # thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy: initially ther was concern for dic. she was given vitamin k initially, however her coagulopathy is likely [**12-27**] to her hepatopathy [**12-27**] to right heart failure. her coags were followed as well as monitoring for signs of bleeding. no further intervention was necessary.  her inr is high at 2.5. she does not have any active signs of bleeding and has stable anemia with a hemoglobin between 8 and 9. . # hyperbilirubinimia: thought to be associated with congestive hepatopathy from rv hypokinesis.  we monitored her liver functions were showed increasing bilirubin.  she became more jaundiced throughout her stay.  her belly exam remained intermittently tight and distended, worsening at time, but improves often after dialysis.  she is asymptomatic.  we discussed possibly doing a therapeutic paracentesis, but with her his risk and lack of symptoms, we decided against it. . # peripheral vascular disease - the patient developed what appears to be arterial ulcers on her bilateral big toes.  they do not seem infected, but she has symptoms of pain in her heels, occassionally her hands.  we did ultrasounds studies of her abis which were 0.4 and 0.6 in r and l respectively.  we tried to control her pain with oxycodone, but patient refusing narcotic meds.  tylenol up to 2 gms daily can be used for symptom relief.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

History of Present Illness:
 49 year old male with aids (last cd4 17 when he initially presented), off haart and non-compliant, being transferred from [**hospital 12017**] [**hospital 71377**] hospital for further management of intracranial masses and seizure. recent history includes a duodenal perforation with resultant polymicrobial liver abscess in [**2154-12-22**] that was treated and resolved. he presented to [**location (un) 12017**] regional on [**11-19**] with progressive gait unsteadiness, headache, and seizures; ct/mri at the time showed multiple subcortical ring enhancing lesions, most prominently in the right parietal region, with some associated edema. he was started on sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine for presumed toxoplasmosis treatment, as well as dilantin for seizures, but did not improve. he had an lp on [**11-21**] which showed 6 rbc, 8 wbc (31% pmn, 48% lymphs, 21% monos), with a protein of 48 and glucose of 57. bacterial cultures were negative, as were other more specific microbial studies (see below). decadron was added. the patient's confusion worsened, necessitating change from sulfadiazine to clindamycin so that it could be administered iv. interestingly, toxoplasmosis igg and igm antibodies returned negative, in addition to csf toxo pcr. an extensive workup for potential malignancy was undertaken, including ct torso (negative) and colonoscopy given an elevated cea of 14.2 (also unrevealing). . the patient's right sided weakness improved, though he had ongoing right sided incoordination. he also had a mild left 7th cranial nerve palsy. a repeat mri on [**12-3**] showed further progression of the mass lesions. neurosurgery was involved, and ultimately proceeded to brain biopsy on [**12-7**] via left parietal craniotomy. the aspiration revealed purulent material, however cultures have remained negative. cytology did not demonstrate malignant cells. due to concern for pyogenic abscess, meropenem was initiated at this point ([**12-8**]). dexamethasone was discontinued following the surgery, and he remained seizure free during the hospitalization. . he had a fever to 100 on [**12-13**] at which point metronidazole was added. on [**12-14**] he began developing difficulty with nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea. c. diff assay was negative. he was more lethargic and mildly hypoxic, in addition to increasing confusion and hallucinations. blood and urine cultures were obtained on [**12-15**] when he spiked to 101.3. mri was repeated, demonstrating progressive enlargement of his subcortical lesions, as well as a pontine lesion and apparent new medullary lesion. dexamethasone was resumed at this point (had been d/c'ed on [**12-8**]). clindamycin and meropenem were discontinued at this point in favor of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 5 mg/kg iv q 12 hours for possible pcp (?). vancomycin was added as well. a tte was undertaken which demonstrated calcification of the chordae of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, without being able to exclude a vegetation. subsequently, both sets of blood cultures from [**12-15**] revealed gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. two sets obtained earlier on the same day remain without growth. blood cultures from [**11-22**] and [**11-19**] are also no growth to date. . of note, he was started on haart during this hospitalization on [**12-10**] after cd4 count noted to be 17, and genotyping was sent (pending at the time of dishcarge). . currently, he denies pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
 in brief, the patient is a 49 year old man with hiv/aids who was transferred to [**hospital1 18**] for further management of multiple brain lesions who course was complicated by bacteremia, an intra-abdominal abscess secondary to small bowel obstruction, multifocal pneumonia, hypoxic respiratory failure, cmv viremia, pancytopenia, hypotension, malnutrition, and deconditioning. . #ring enhancing brain lesions:  ddx at time of admission included toxoplasmosis, cns lympoma, disseminated fungal infection, or possibly bacterial abscesses.  given recent vre bacteremia (see below), tee was obtained which was negative.  of note, data from osh showed negative toxo ab and negative toxo from csf.  ebv from brain bx fluid was positive, however rasing the possibility of lymphoma.  at [**hospital1 18**], lp repeated. toxo negative, [**male first name (un) 2326**]/ebv/ [cmv] negative.  empirically treated for toxo with iv bactrim; for cns lymphoma with iv decadron; and for bacterial abscesses with meropenem.  underwent repeat mri which showed improvement of his lesions.  he will thus continue on these medications, in addition to the voriconazole that was started primarily for the pulmonary process but could have also led to improvement in the cns lesions.  he will need follow up with id, dr [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) **], for repeat imaging with brain mri and abdominal ct to define the course of treatment, as well as weekly lfts, bun and cr, cbc, and cpk while on meropenem and daptomycin. . #vre bacteremia/intraabd abscess:  the day or two prior to transfer to [**hospital1 18**], the patient noted increased abdominal swelling.  at [**hospital1 18**], kub/ct demonstrated high grade sbo with transition point in distal jejunum. surgery consulted for ?biopsy (given concern for possible lymphoma/transition point) and recommended conservative management with ivf, npo and ngt to suction.  sbo clinically resolved and ngt d/c'd.  repeat ct showed enlargement of the abscess, which contained air, barium, fluid with surrounding inflamation of the sigmoid colon and fat stranding. the findings were suggestive of a possible fistulization between the colon and abscess. the patient was initially treated with two week course of iv linezolid. ct guided aspirate culture grew vancomycin resistant enterococcus. he was kept npo and received his nutrition via tpn. the ct guided drain continued to drain the collection.  given the patient's high expected surgical morbidity and mortality, he was managed with expectant management. follow-up imaging over the next 2 months revealed gradual improvement of the fluid collection.  the drain ultimately fell out with no evident of re-expansion of the fluid collection. the follow-up imaging did not reveal persistence of the fistulous tract from the colon to the abscess. . although the abscess is being treated with antibiotics, surgery consult has followed periodically for possible operative management of abscess and diverticulitis. as part of planning any surgery that could involve removal of part of the colon, imaging of the entire colon, ie to screen for co-incident cancer, would be required. because of the patient's diverticular disease complicated by abscess, barium enema carries a risk of re-injuring the diverticulum that was associated with the abscess and is therefore relatively contraindicated, given the recent occurence of the abscess. virtual colonoscopy, which has limited value in patients with diverticular disease, is contraindicated for the same reason, as insufflation of air in teh colon could perforate the recently abscessed diverticulum. colonoscopy was attempted, but the patient's blood pressure response to sedation limited sedation and anesthesia and the endoscope could not be advanced beyond the sigmoid with the maximal level of sedation attained. he will therefore need repeat colonoscopy when healthier over all to screen for colon cancer, and further discussion of sigmoidectomy to prevent future diverticulosis. . similar to the brain abscess above, he will need repeat imaging with ct of abdomen and pelvis in [**12-23**] weeks and will then visit his id/hiv specialist dr [**last name (stitle) **] to discuss duration of antibiotic therapy.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

however pt not a surgical candidate given poor nutritional state. she was therefore treated with 3 wks of vanc/zosyn with no further signs of infection.  she was discharged with an ostomy bag draining the fistula. . 3. tachy/bradycardia: pt noted to have runs of narrow complex svt through sicu and started on metoprolol; then noted to have bradycardia and beta blockade held. ep was consulted and did not feel any intervention warranted. off beta blockade, had fewer episodes of bradycardia and noted to have 4.5 second pauses, so transferred to ccu for further monitoring. after transfer to the ccu, a family meeting was held to discuss the possibility of pacemaker placement, however not consistent with goals of care which are to avoid further interventions and procedures.  pt was discharged off of her bblocker given risk of bradycardia, and hrs in the low 100s were tolerated. . 4. mental status: has baseline dementia with superimposed delirium, although unclear whether this may also be her new baseline mental status. she was occasionally oriented to person only, alert and conversational but oftentimes lethargic, but would respond to voice and carry conversational. she was often inattentive though. she could do days of the week forward with frequent prompting and months of the year forward to about [**month (only) 216**], again with frequent prompting. she had improved greatly through her course though with ability to state days of the week backwards in the week prior to discharge and at baseline ms per family . 5. nutrition: pt with low albumin precluding fistula repair. in discussion with surgery, she was a poor candidate for peg placement her hx of pulling tubes.  dobhoff was placed but then pulled by pt.  discussion of goals of care was held with family and palliative care, who opted for no further interventions to help improve pts nutrition other than supervision while eating and nutritional supplements. . 6. htn/pump: she was continued on metoprolol (as above, continued on it after pacer placement), lasix, valsartan, simva, baby asa. she had an echo while admitted that showed ef 60% but with some evidence of diastolic failure through elevated pulmonary pressure. she was grossly anasarcatous but unlikely due to chf, more likely due to poor albumin and overly aggressive volume resuscitation.  her bblocker was held due to her bradycardia, and simvastatin and asa were dc'd on discharge given newly defined goals of care.  she was discharged on a smaller dose of lasix than what she was taking on admission due to her poor po intake. . 7. dm: continued on regular insulin sliding scale with good control. . 8. anemia: hct's stable through admission. has h/o gib, was continued on ppi. ostomy contents were guaic and were positive, so likely having chronic slow ooze from gi tract. hct 27 and stable on discharge. . 8. goals of care: extensive goals of care discussion was held by medical team, palliative care and pts family whose goals are towards comfort.  therefore, pacemaker and peg tube placement were not done and medications were minimized on discharge.  she was permitted to maintain hr in the 100s given decision not to place pacemaker.  hospice has been notified at her rehab facility and the family will follow up with them on discharge. family also expressed interest in not rehospitalizing, however this will need to be further addressed by hospice on discharge. pts code status was changed to dnr/dni during the hospitalization. . comm: [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**known lastname 56684**] (in [**country **]) [**telephone/fax (1) 86637**].

Brief Hospital Course:
 77yo f with nine day [**hospital3 **] course notable for findings of pna and pe, presenting with worsening hypoxia. . # hypoxia - patient with progressively worsening hypoxia, with known pna and pulmonary emboli on osh imaging. it was felt that the patient likely had an underlying infectious process driving the gradual worsening of her medical condition, especially given limited community acquired pneumonia treatment at outside hospital. the pulmonary emboli was felt to possibly be worsening, precipitating her decline although this was not able to be confirmed given she was far too ill to travel for a cta; this was felt to be less likely in the setting of her supratherapeutic inr, recent lovenox administration, and her ivc filter placement. the patient's abg showed significant a-a gradient, her pao2/fio2 was suggestive of ards as were her cxrs on admission (bilateral fluffy infiltrates). the patient developed worsening respiratory distress upon arrival (hypoxia, shortness of breath, tachypnea) and was intubated/sedated shortly after presentation. her antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin and meropenem and cultures drawn (blood, urine, sputum). there was no growth to date by the time the patient expired. she was maintained on ardsnet protocol but required paralysis with cisatracurium for high plateau pressures, dysyncrony with the vent, and high tidal volumes prior to paralysis. . # sepsis/multiorgan failure - the patient continued to decompensate with rising lactate, lfts, inr, creatinine. her blood pressures dipped into the systolic 80s and was gradually broadened to vasopressin, levophed and neosynephrine for pressors. she was aggressively volume resuscitated and her pressures were fluid responsive. she was also started on stress dose steroids. despite aggressive resuscitation measures, however, her lactate, lfts, inr and creatinine continued to climb. in discussions with the family, she was made dnr/dni and ultimately comfort measures only. pressor support was discontinued and the patient passed away shortly thereafter, with her husband, children and extended family at the bedside. because of her rapid decompensation, the family requested autopsy to be performed. . # tachycardia - the patient presented with tachycardia, hr110s and initially in sinus rhythm. thus, it was felt that she was most likely septic and hypovolemic with low urine output and dry mucus membranes. at the time, her creatinine was normal. the patient received aggressive ivf rehydration (6 liters overnight) but continued to be persistently tachycardic and eventually transitioned in atrial fibrillation/flutter. the patient received one bolus of amiodarone without improvement in her heart rate, requiring uptitration of her neosynephrine, so further amiodarone was discontinued. . # supratherapeutic inr - inr >4 on admission, likely in setting of poor coumadin processing in septic physiology, with antibiotics. the patient was treated with vitamin k. she continued to develop worsening inr (up to 6) with worsening liver function during this hospitalization. . # elevated troponin - reportedly elevated troponin at osh and here as well. initially troponing here was 0.16 with flat mb, no chest pain, twi on v1-3 on ekg. gradually ck bumped but not the mb or mbi. it was felt that the patient likely had some demand ischemia. her echo showed depressed ejection fraction of 30% but without focal wall motion abnormality.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

[**month/year (2) 8974**] sepsis from prevertebral abscess s/p anterior cervical diskectomy: patient was found to have blood cultures positive for [**month/year (2) 8974**] on [**3-22**] so she was initially started on daptomycin due to potential allergy to vancomycin but then switched to nafcillin, cefepime, and flagyl for broad coverage. source was felt to be prevertebral fluid collection noted on ct of the neck on [**3-23**]. she triggered on the floor for hypotension with sbp 80 which was initially fluid responsive but eventually persisted despite boluses so she was transferred to the icu for further management. after discussion between ent, ortho spine, and neurosurgery, the patient went for anterior neck exploration by ent and ortho spine and anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion was performed at c5-6 and c6-7 along with incision and drainage of prevertebral abscess on [**3-25**]. patient remained intubated post-procedure due to significant procedure-related edema and her antibiotics were narrowed to nafcillin single-[**doctor last name 360**] therapy. patient's blood pressures were persistently low and she remained pressor dependent until [**2116-4-7**], when she was extubated. due to patient's persistent hypotension despite resolution of bacteremia and drainage of abscess, studies were undertaken to evaluate for other potential sources of infection and she was broadened to dapto/meropenem. u/s of the fistula showed no signs of thrombus, tte showed no vegetations, and ct abdomen/pelvis showed no abscesses or other acute infectious process. despite persistent hypotension and elevated lactate, patient remained arousable and consistently able to follow commands. after 5 days of dapto/[**last name (un) **] her antibiotics were changed to nafcillin monotherapy due to improving bp, absence of a 2nd infectious source and decreasing pressor requirement. however, she developed a cholestatic hepatitis and her nafcillin was switched back to daptomycin. id then recommended transitioning daptomycin to cefazolin. the pt has a documented cefazolin allergy, so desensitization was undertaken but the patient developed anaphylaxis (see below). she was planned to have a 8 week total course (last day = [**5-19**]) of daptomycin for her abscess and will follow up with ortho spine and id for ongoing management. her surgical wound had intermittent trace bleeding, though her hct remained stable and her incision appeared well healing at the time of discharge. . #cefazolin desensitization/anaphylaxis: patient developed cholestatic hepatitis thought to be secondary to nafcillin therapy prompting switch to daptomycin to cover [**month/year (2) 8974**] sepsis. patient had documented cefazolin allergy and desensitization protocol was attempted which she tolerated initially but she then developed anaphylaxis to 1mg of cefazolin characterized by wheezing, sob, tripoding, stridor and received epinephrine, hydrocortisone, benadryl and ranitidine with resolution of her symptoms without recrudescence of symptoms in 48 hours. . # pseudomonal pneumonia c/b respiratory failure and sepsis: pt became stridorous in the setting of a retropharyngeal abscess and was intubated on [**2116-3-24**] for airway protection. she required massive fluid recussitation for sepsis and developed pulmonary edema, which may also have contributed to her failure. she also has underlying copd, which was a likely contributing factor to her poor pulmonary substrate and respiratory failure. her abscess was evacuated and she had acdf of c5-c6 and c6-c7 with ortho spine. she remained intubated due to concern for airway edema until [**2116-4-7**], when she was extubated without event. she then developed fevers, relative hypotension, and respiratory distress with sputum cultures growing pseudomonas. she ultimately required a second intubation and pressors for a priod of time. she was treated with a course of meropenem and amikacin per id recommendation and improved. she was extubated without further significant issues and weaned off pressors for >2 weeks prior to discharge. she was satting well on nasal cannula, afebrile, and without respiratory distress at the time of discharge. . # cholestatic hepatitis: patient's direct bilirubin and transaminases started to acutely rise on [**3-27**]. on exam, patient was also noted to have increased distention and tenderness. u/s of the gallbladder and ct of the abdomen showed only cirrhosis and no acute pathology. cefepime was discontinued due to concern for liver toxicity. etiology was initially thought to be due to acute hepatic decompensation in the setting of critical illness. her lfts remained persistently elevated, and acutely worsened with initiation of nafcillin therapy, which was subsequently discontinued (see above). her hepatitis was felt to be [**3-5**] medication effect, though would note that she has underlying hcv. hbv serologies were negative. . # multifactorial anemia: likely anemia of chronic disease and anemia of esrd. she required intermittent blood transfusions throughout her course, though had no evidence of active bleeding. stool guiac was repeatedly negative. she should continue receiving epo with hd per renal. . # ileus: in the setting of her acute illness and opiate use for pain control, ms [**known lastname 11182**] developed an ileus. for this she received naloxone x1 as well as an aggressive bowel regemin. her ileus was intermittent and resolved; at the time of discharge she was tolerating her tube feeds and a po diet of clear liquids. . # hypotension: ms [**known lastname 11182**] was intermittently hypotensive and requiring pressors throughout her course. initially, her hypotension was almost certainly due to sepsis, which was treated with appropriate antibiotics. later in her course she continued to require pressors with hd and her midodrine was increased to 15mg tid. she was also started on high dose thiamine due to concern for dry beri-beri, with marked improvement in her bps. . # picc associated rue dvt: given her heparin allergy, ms [**known lastname **] was started on an argatroban gtt for her dvt after her picc was removed. hematology was consulted and recommended an argatroban normogram, which was continued for the duration of her micu stay. . # hiv versus critical illness neuropathy: given her multiple medical problems, poor nutrition, prolonged hospital course and peipheral neuropathy, there was concern for dry beri-beri. for this she was started on high dose thiamine with initial improvement in her neuropathy. however, her neuropathy subsequently returned and neurology was consulted who felt it may be consistent with critical illness polysneuropathy. her primary team felt her symptoms were likely related to her chronic hiv. she was trialed on low dose gabapentin but intermittently appeared sedated so that medication was discontinued. . chronic issues: . # hiv ([**2-13**] cd4 375): her home haart regemin was continued throughout her course. viral load early on in her admission was 183. . # lip/copd/asthma: her home albuterol/ipratroprium were continued throughout her course. at the time of discharge, she was breathing comfortably on nasal cannula. . # pulm htn: her sildenafil 50mg po tid was initially held for hypotension, but was restarted once she was off pressors. . # esrd: started on cvvh while on pressor support. she had a l subclavian temp hd line placed and received intermittent cvvh until weaned off pressors. her temp hd line was pulled on [**2116-4-7**] she thereafter she received intermitted hd through her fistula in order to take off acumulated volume. she was transistioned to t/th/sat schedule prior to discharge. . # chronic thrombocytopenia: ms [**known lastname 11182**] is chronically thrombocytopenic, though her platelet counts on this admission were markedly lower. her chronic thrombocytopenia may be related to her liver disease, and her acute decompensation may be multifactorial and due to acute hepatic decompensation and cvvh. she had intermittent, small volume bleeding through her surgical incision and from her occipital pressure ulcer. . # elevated inr: felt to be partly due to decompensation of patient's underlying cirrhosis but also due to antibiotic use. patient was intermittently repleted with vitamin k. . transitional issues: . #goals of care: after significant discussions with the patient's family (primarily her daughter), she was remained full code throughout this admission. . #consider outpatient pelvic us for 4.3 x 3.8 cm right ovarian cyst seen on abdominal ct, which is unchanged since [**2113**]. . #please follow q3 month cd4 counts and re-initiate bactrim prophylaxis for cd4 count below 200.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Brief Hospital Course:
 the patient arrived from outside hospital in extremis. of his many problems, the following were prioritized, given his overall poor condition: for the patient's respiratory failure, he arrived intubated and his ventilation was continued mechanically with no attempts to wean. his primary issues appeared to be secondary to a possible colchicine overdose and/or sepsis. the patient had a known suicide attempt five days before presentation. according to the patient's girlfriend, in addition to aripiprazole and clonazepam, he took whatever was left of his colchicine prescription. colchicine toxicity manifests as gastroenteritis, pancytopenias, cardiac abnormalities, and various other issues. by the point of his admission to [**hospital1 18**], the colchicine would have been widely distributed to his organ systems. in addition, the patient could have been septic. it was not clear what the patient's source of infection is, though he had several possible sites. his open right knee wound is possible and could be polymicrobial if infected. he had been treated with antibiotics for osteomyelitis in the past, but was seen by orthopedics who did not feel that that the open area on knee was the source of infection. there was no purulence or fluctuance. given the strong possibility of colchicine overdose, bacteremia from translocation across the damaged gi mucosa was also a possibility. his chest films were not suggestive of pneumonia, but per preliminary radiology read, it could not be ruled out.  the patient was started on vancomycin, metronidazole, and meropenem to cover broad array of possible organisms from either wound, pulmonary, or gut source.       once the patient arrived to [**hospital1 18**], he almost immediately became hemodynamically unstable. the patient was bradycardic into the 20s without consistent femoral pulse. epinephrine was provided, which brought him out of the bradycardia. the antibiotics were quickly loaded via iv. abgs showed a substantial acidosis, for which some bicarbonate was given as a temporizing measure. the leading diagnoses continued to be either colchicine overdose or sepsis. the patient's ex-wife and his girlfriend were both notified of his poor condition, but were informed that we would try dialysis as a last-ditch measure. before a dialysis catheter could be placed, the patient's blood pressure began to drop and was unresponsive to fluids. pressors were started and the patient needed three pressors to keep his systolic blood pressure above 80. he continued to be oliguric; as he was sedated, mental status could not be appreciated. cvvh was instituted following the placement of a femoral dialysis catheter, though cvvh would likely not clear colchicine, if that was the source of his shock. several hours of cvvh did not help the patient in any appreciable way. during this resuscitation phase, the patient's pupils were seen to be dilated and non-responsive to light. he was too unstable to undergo head ct.  he continued to show acidosis on his abgs; the patient would have episodes of bradycardia that would respond to an amp of bicarbonate but then quickly return. at this point, the patient's next of [**doctor first name **] was then notified again and made aware that it would be unlikely that he would have any recovery. the decision was then made to remove pressors and stop using bicarbonate therapy. the patient died shortly thereafter.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

 64 yo f with hepatitis c cirrhosis who was admitted to osh on [**5-24**] for hepatic encephalopathy and failure to thrive and transferred here on [**6-15**] to the hepatorenal service for further mgmt. pt was noted to have r hydrothorax which was tapped for 1.5 liters. she was also found to have an enterococcal uti for which she was treated with ampicillin/vancomycin. she was starting to develop a hepatorenal picture on her first several days on the floor, was aggressively diuresed with an increase in creatinine and oliguria, then became anuric. she was then given a fluid challenge with albumin and subsequently developed pulmonary edema on the l side, requiring nrb. she was transferred to the micu on [**6-20**] and was intubated and started on cvvh. her r pleural effusion was tapped in the micu; dr. [**last name (stitle) 497**] did not wish to have a pigtail catheter. she had a total of 72 hrs of cvvh. during cvvh, she was hypotensive, initially felt to be hypovolemic (intravascularly depleted) and possibly septic and her abx was broadened from ampicillin to cover enterococci uti to vanc/cefepime though all other culture data was negative. pt did not have enough ascites to tap. she was then noted to have failed her [**last name (un) 104**] stim (she was previously on prednisone for copd flare at osh) and was started on stress dose steroids. this was tapered to 10 mg po prednisone on [**7-2**]. on she is now normotensive with sbp in 120s back on her home bisoprolol, which has been titrated up. uop has also returned and she was restarted on lasix/aldactone. she was stable enough to transfer back to the hepatorenal floor service by [**2195-7-3**] where she was stable but with guarded status given her hepatorenal syndrome. her issues are summarized by issue below: . # hepatorenal syndrome: pt came in w/cr of 1.2. and was rapidly climbing. urine studies were c/w hrs type/prerenal over atn. pt was anuric after uf on [**6-20**]; uop has returned. off cvvh since friday [**6-26**], hd line dc'd [**6-12**]. however, the patient's cr remained at 1.9 which had been trending upwards. uop slowing down on the floor, so on [**2195-7-3**] she was started mitodrine 5mg tid, octreotide 100mg sc tid. renal was involved regarding management of her fluid status as we would prefer to remove fluid by hd to protect kidneys than give fluid by albumin as pt had fluid overload, resp distress last time. the family is aware that her status is guarded and after many discussions, the decision was made to discharge her to home with hospice. . # hypotension/sepsis: initially thought to be likely multifactorial with the main component being recent thoracentesis and then hd session with removal of 2l of uf. there was mild response from sbp of low 80s to high 80s after 500 cc bolus of ivfs and 1 unit of prbcs. however, map began to drift below 60 in am of [**6-21**] and pt was started on levophed. bp also began to fall after intubation, may be due to meds v. positive pressure ventilation (however, higher peep seems to be improving aeration of r lung). pt is less likely to be septic given hr, lack of fever, lack of leukocytosis though pt began to deteriorate after switching from vanc to amp. the patient's antibiotic coverage was broadened in the icu to cefepime/vanc as pt began to deteriorate after switching from vanc to amp for enterococcal uti-treat for a two week course ending on [**7-6**]. adrenal insufficiency now considered to be primary cause. by the time she was transferred from the icu, she was off all pressors, and antibiotic coverage for sepsis. her bp ran high so she was restarted on bisoprolol 10mg daily which was discontinued on [**2195-7-3**] as her bp was starting to trend downwards. the patient was also restarted on midodrine and octreotide to maintain her bp. . # s/p hypoxic respiratory failure in the icu: this is likely due to pulm edema after fluid resuscitation in the setting of r hydrothorax and anuria, also mental status. per liver, no pigtail catheter as patient was still being considered for liver transplant. she was successfully extubated on [**6-29**], satting well on room air. on the floor after transfer from the icu, the patient's respiratory status has been stable. . # adrenal insufficiency- the patient had an abnormal [**last name (un) 104**] stim test while septic, so given stress dose steroids and quickly tapered off steroids by [**2195-7-4**]. her blood pressure remained stable off the steroids. . #hypernatremia-likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion. the patient's tube feeds were adjusted to correct for hypernatremia. . #hyperglycemia: likely exacerbated by stress dose steroids and tpn. the patient's lantus was uptitrated given the patient's hyperglycemia. . # uti: the patient was initially found to have enterococcal uti which was adequately treated with ampicillin and vancomycin. she continued to grow out yeast in her cultures so was started on [**2195-7-4**] on a course of fluconazole. . # hepatic encephalopathy: no signs of infection or abnormalities in portal flow. pt has only trace ascites, difficult to tap. she was continued on lactulose and rifaximin titrating up to keep bm>4/day . # hep c cirrhosis and end stage liver disease: patient with meld of 37 on [**2195-7-8**] and complications including hrs, recurrent hepatic hydrothorax. patient was treated for hepatorenal syndrome as above. . # recurrent r hydrothorax: patient had been reaccumulating fluid during her hospital stay given her liver function. she had multiple thoracenteses on the floor and on the unit. . # copd: patient was transferred from osh on steroid taper for presumed copd flare. she was continued on albuterol and ipratroprium nebs prn and her home advair (fluticasone/salmeterol) 100/50 1 puff [**hospital1 **], combivent (ipratroprium/albuterol) 18 mcg-103 mcg (90 mcg)/actuation aerosol 2 puffs twice a day. no evidence of copd flare during this stay. . dispo: patient was discharged to home with hospice. .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Brief Hospital Course:
 [**hospital 153**] hospital course: . #  shortness of breath/hypoxia:  upon admission, the patient was in acute hypoxic distress requiring almost 100% fio2 high flow oxygen.  his acute decompensation was most likely secondary to pneumonia compounded by metastatic esophageal disease.  pe was thought to be less likely despite the positive history of pe and malignancy, especially as the patient was on prophylaxtic lovenox at home.  dopplers of the lower extremities were negative for dvt.  a tte with bubble study showed no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  upon admission, the patient was started on empiric antibiotic course of vancomycin and cefepime for hcap. tobramycin was added for double coverage after blood cx from the emergency department grew gnr, but was discontinued once sensitivities were back.  additionally, the patient received albuterol and atrovent inhalers prn, was gently diuresed with lasix, and was encouraged to ambulate/ use incentive spirometry to prevent atelectasis.  despite completing an 8 day course of vancomycin and a (14) day course of ceftazadime (switch from cefepime on day 10 of therapy due to new susceptibility report of gnr), the patient's respiratory status did not improve significantly.  a thoracic ct w/o contrast confirmed diffuse metastatic disease compressing the bronchioles and the patient's respiratory compromise was largely irreversible.  prior to transfer from the icu, the patient was referred to palliative care (see below).  at time of discharge from icu the patient was stable on high flow oxygen with 60% fio2 and 6lnc. . #  fever/leukocytosis:  the patient's initial sepsis was attributed to bacterial pneumonia based on cxr and symptoms. the patient was empirically started on vancomycin and cefepime for hap.  urine culture was negative.  blood cultures from the ed grew gnr so tobramycin was added for double coverage.  this was discontinued after 2 days once antibiotic sensitivities returned.  the patient completed an 8 day course of vancomycin. on day 10, cefepime was switched to ceftazadime based on new antibiotic sensitivity profile from the patient's initial positive blood culture.  over icu course the patient defervesed and his wbc count returned to [**location 213**].  unfortunately his respiratory status did not greatly improve (see above). . #  esophageal cancer with cns and lung metastases:  the patient's primary oncologist, dr. [**last name (stitle) 99949**] was notified of the patient's admission and progress throughout his stay in the icu. the patient was continued on chronic dose of prednisone as per neurooncologist due to symptoms of mild adrenal insuffieciency. when it was determined that metastatic disease contributed to respiratory decline, primary oncologist was involved with discussion with patient regarding his poor prognosis.  the patient has decided to receive palliative care at home following this hospitalization. . #  diabetes type ii: stable with humalog sliding scale . # fen: encouraged increased po intake with dietary supplementations.  electrolytes were monitored serially and repleted as needed. . # prophylaxis: the patient rmained on outpatient lovenox for dvt prophylaxis and ppi for stress ulcer prophylaxis.  the patient also remained on outpatient dapsone for pcp prophylaxis in the setting of chronic prednisone use . #code: dnr/dni confirmed with patient .

[**known lastname 75204**] is [**age over 90 **] y.o. female without clear cognitive impairment, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic colitis who presented with with abdominal pain and hypotension. . on arrival to the [**hospital1 18**] er, her vs were t 34.7 rectal (93.4f), bp 96/66, hr 69, rr 26 and sats 100% on nrb. given her abdominal pain and h/o ischemic colitis, there was concern for an intraabdominal process. initial labs revealed worsening renal function, a bicarb of 9, and a lactate of 4.0. she was given flagyl and levaquin iv, with plans to perform an abdomen and pelvis ct. interpreters were called in order to communicate with the patient and the patient refused surgery if that was what would be needed. after lengthy discussions with the patient, her family, and the interpreters, the conclusion was that there would be no imaging as the patient would not pursue surgical intervention if an abnormality was found. given that she was a known dnr/dni, the decision was made to not put a cvl in and she would be treated with ivf, iv antibiotics and pain medication as needed. in the er, her bp ranged from 72-123/39-99, hr 58-67, and o2 sats 96-100% on 2l nc. it was noted that the interpreter was called repeatedly for ? of agitation, restlessness and pain (mostly in her legs). in total, she received 100mcg iv fentanyl and 16mg iv morphine between 1800 and 2100. she was then transferred to the floor to be [**hospital1 3225**]. . however, on arrival to the floor, the patient's family inquired about antibiotics and goals of care were readdressed. it was then felt that the patient was not truly [**hospital1 3225**], but that she would want care up to the point of cpr and intubation. in the midst of this conversation, she became somnolent and unresponsive to sternal rub. her o2 sats dropped down to 76% on 10l and she was placed on a nrb. her hr was noted to be down in the 30s and her temperature was 92. she was given 1l ns bolus and a total of 0.6mg narcan with minimal improvement. decision was made to transfer her to the icu for further care. . in the icu, she continued to decline. it was felt that her hypotension was likely due to sepsis, probably from her uti but an abdominal source could not be excluded. her antibiotics were thus broadened to meropenem, ciprofloxacin, linezolid and flagyl (to double-cover for gnr and to cover for both mrsa and vre - she had positive swabs for both in the past). she was given ivf (with bicarbonate, given her low bicarbonate on labs) to attempt to maintain a sbp >90 or a map >60. however, given her dni status, fluid resuscitation was limited by her respiratory status. she was warmed with a bairhugger and was also started on steroids for presumed adrenal insufficiency from sepsis. she was also found to be bradycardic, which was concerning. her calcium was repleted and we attempted to improve her bicarbonate by supplementing her ivf with bicarbonate. glucagon was considered, given that the patient is on lopressor and cardizem at home, but it was felt to be less likely due to her medications given that she had not yet received her medications today. repeat lab tests revealed an inr of 22.8 and showed that the patient was in worsening renal failure. . a discussion was held with the family ([**first name9 (namepattern2) 22858**] [**doctor first name **]) in the icu regarding the patient's poor prognosis. she understood the patient's grave state, but wanted to continue antibiotics and ivf resuscitation. the patient remained a dnr/dni. the patient's status continued to decline overnight. she became persistently hypotensive despite multiple ivf boluses. her granddaughter [**name (ni) **] was notified of her worsening status. the patient's oxygen saturations then began to drop, she remained somnolent, and her bradycardia progressed to asystole. she expired at 5:25am on [**2123-8-11**]. her granddaughter was notified and refused an autopsy. given that the patient was in the hospital less then 24 hours, the medical examiner was also notified and refused the case. .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Chief Complaint:
 1. ischemic colitis versus necrosis versus colitis. 2. incisional hernia. 3. sepsis.

History of Present Illness:
 mr. [**known lastname **] is a 66 year old male with history of parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, cad, dm, cva, s/p suprapubic catheter and recent sbo who was recently admitted to [**hospital **] hospital in both [**month (only) 205**] and [**2173-7-21**] for uti with lab data revealing for klebsiella and 2 species of pseudomonas with multiple resistances (see below). the patient was discharged back to his nursing facility with ongoing treatment for pseudomonas uti with ciprofloxacin. over the last 2 days the patient has been noted to be increasingly lethargic at his nursing facility. this a.m. the patient was very lethargic and noted to be in respiratory distress with vomiting of coffee ground emesis. the patient was brought to [**hospital **] hospital where peripheral pulses could not be detected. the patient underwent rapid sequence intubation and was started on levophed for hypotension. no compressions were performed (using versed, succ, vecuronium), nadir blood pressure is not documented although sbp of 70s with levophed reported by ed. abg at [**hospital **] hospital at time of intubation/code was 6.90/40/7/xx per report. the patient was treated with gentamycin 120mg iv x1, and ceftriaxone 1gm iv x1. the patient was transferred to [**hospital1 18**] for ongoing management.

Brief Hospital Course:
 the patient was transferred to [**hospital1 18**] from [**hospital **] hospital on [**8-13**] for severe sepsis.  the patient was intubated and resuscitated before being brought to the or for an exploratory lapartomy.  the patient was found to have an ischemic bowel, resulting in a total colectomy and ileostomy.  the patient was then transferred to the sicu for post-operative care.",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
"Chief Complaint:
 hypoxemia, confusion

History of Present Illness:
 88 m nh ([**doctor first name **]) pt, apparently sent to [**hospital1 12355**] c/o chest pain.  [**name6 (md) **] [**name (ni) 2090**] rn, pt doing well until 1d pta, when ""not feeling well"", denied cp, sob, fever, had cxr, kub and labs at nh which were normal per report. . pt takent to [**hospital1 8**]-[**location (un) 407**] with c/o cp and neckpain , no sob, n/v, mildly confused.  vs=90.8  52 119/80  20 up to 92.8 with bear hugger, bcx drawn, lactate 0.7, ekg=lbbb (old), cxr bilateral infilrtrate, given levo/flagyl, 20 iv lasix.  sats 98%2l. . pt transferreed to [**hospital1 8**], vs= 98.3  78  139/91 94-98%ra, taken to ct abd/pelvis (bilateral pleural effusion, small pericardial effusion), for c/o vague abd pain, and upon returning, noted to have increasing o2 requiringment 99%4l-> 92%6l.  abg= 7.39/46/74 on 6l nc.  pt given lasix 20mg iv x 1, combivent nebs.  per ed resident, pt confused, tachypnic (though rr=24), and per anesthesia note, pt combative, he was therefore intubated for apparent hypoxia as he would not wear nrb mask.  pt then sent for ct head given delta ms, to r/o sah, and admitted to micu for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
 88 m nursing home resident, with history of hypertension, lymphedema, depression, was admitted with confusion and hypoxemia, diagnosed with pneumonia, pleural effusions, nstemi, and lymphedema. . # pneumonia: patient had decompensating o2 sat readings after a ct scan (no shortness of breath, no rash, no itching after baracat however), and was intubated secondary to worsening hypoxemia, confusion, refusal to wear the nrb, and difficulty in defending his airway. cxr showed bilateral pleural effusions and possible pneumonia. he completed 10 day courses of levofloxacin and vancomycin, with clinical improvement in sputum production. sputum cultures were negative. on admission, the patient had been hypothermic to 95.7, normotensive, which was concerning for sepsis, but remained normotensive and normothermic for the rest of hospital stay. he required extensive nt suctioning for several days, and his suctioning needs are still every few hours daily. he does not have a clear gag reflex and may be chronically aspirating without proper suctioning. . # pleural effusions: bilateral on cxr, moderate in size, were not tapped since they were attributed to chf and global right heart failure, and would likely be recurrent. tte showed ef 35%, 1+ mr, 1+ tr. . # nstemi: he had an nstemi on arrival, with a decrease in ef after this mi. he has been maintained on asa 81 daily and metoprolol. . # afib: rate control is metoprolol, with hr 80-110, so metoprolol should be titrated up as an outpatient as bp allows. current bp on discharge is 105/55. he was in normal sinus rhythm with frequent apcs on admission, but is currently in afib. he was not cardioverted since he has structural cardiac disease and kept normotension post-nstemi. he is on no rhythm control. anticoagulation should be started at rehab as an outpatient. . # fluid status/lymphedema/pleural effusions: he was diuresed with lasix 20-80 iv prn to length of stay fluid status of -11.2 l. he is being discharged on no lasix, but his fluid status should be closely followed, since he will likely need lasix on a regular basis on his home regimen. . # change in mental status: he was confused on admission, but his mental status has much improved during his hospital stay, and has now returned to baseline per his family. he is able to follow commands, move all extremities, and communicate his wishes. he had a ct head performed initially to assess confusion, but this was negative. there was concern for ttp/hus since he was anemic, thrombocytopenic, febrile, mild renal failure, but there were no schistocytes on peripheral smear, and dic labs were normal. tsh, b12, and folate were normal. . # nutrition: peg tube was placed on [**10-26**]. he was briefly apneic in the setting of peg tube placement, but he recovered with nrb administration. tube feeds should be started at rehab upon arrival. nutrition may advise the type and rate of tube feed, since he was not on tube feeds before admission. speech and swallow assessed him twice, and patient would chew and hold the food in his mouth, but he would not swallow any food or fluids (he would hold the food or fluid in his mouth until it was removed or suctioned out). for this reason, s&s could not assess his ability to swallow, and he was thus kept npo. before his peg tube was placed, he had a dobhoff post-pyloric placed, which the patient pulled out after one day. . # hypertension: well-controlled. he was on nifedipine 60 daily before admission, and is being discharged on metoprolol, which may be titrated up as needed. . # abdominal pain: resolved within the first day of admission after bowel movement. his liver function tests, and pancreatic enzymes were normal. . # diabetes mellitus type 2: he was maintained on insulin sliding scale with good control of glucose. . # hypernatremia: he has a tendency to hypernatremia, with na 145-149. he had been repleted with free water with 1-2 liters of d5w iv daily, but free water boluses of 250 ml q8h may be started in rehab upon discharge. daily monitoring of sodium should be performed until free water daily needs are determined. . # high bicarbonate: patient had elevated bicarbonate levels, maximum of 49. he was treated with diamox for 2 days before admission, which worked well to reduce bicarb to 41 on discharge. diamox may continue to work for him as an outpatient, in case his bicarb increases again on discharge. . # anemia: stable, likely from chronic disease. . # poor physical conditioning: patient should receive vigorous pt/ot at rehab as he is severely deconditioned from his recent clinical state. . # depression: patient has a previous history of depression, and also exhibited signs of depression during his hospital stay. he stated that he did not wish to live any longer. the icu team had multiple family meetings with his two sons, daughter-in-law, aunt, and cousin, regarding goals of care. the family felt very strongly that the patient has been expressing the same sentiment and symptoms of depression for the past few years whenever he is sick, and then changes his sentiment to being glad that he is living when he is well. the patient's wishes were difficult to assess since the patient was delirious for the initial half of his hospital stay, and his mental status only gradually returned day by day. . # for general health care issues/code status: he was kept on pantoprazole, heparin sc, and a bowel regimen of senna, colace. his code status was confirmed with the patient and his family as dnr/dni. for contact information with his son: [**name (ni) **] [**name (ni) **]: [**telephone/fax (3) 12356**].",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
