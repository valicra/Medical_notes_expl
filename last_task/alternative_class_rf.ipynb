This analysis revealed that the identified clusters are not representative of specific health issues, primarily due to the lack of consistency in symptoms and the presence of multiple variables involved in the clustering process. Moreover, issues like symptom overlap, individual variability of each patient, and the large number of symptoms contained in the dataset further complicated the analysis.\n","\n","Therefore, these factors contributed to the challenge of identifying clear patterns within the data. The analysis of the obtained results reveals that the RandomForest-based classification model did not produce significant predictions for the source of infection. The evaluation results of the model, expressed through performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, show very low or zero values for all considered infection classes. This suggests that the model was unable to effectively learn the relationships between symptoms and sources of infection, and thus unable to provide accurate predictions.\n","\n","A possible aid for a more precise analysis could be integrating domain expertise and medical knowledge into feature engineering and model development. By leveraging insights from medical professionals, we can design more informative features and select appropriate algorithms tailored to the specific characteristics of medical data. Additionally, conducting further research to deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of different infections and their manifestations in symptoms could provide invaluable insights.
