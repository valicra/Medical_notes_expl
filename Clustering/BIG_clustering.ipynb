end-stage renal disease not on dialysis who presents with st elevation infarction.  he was recently admitted with unstable angina and was discharged 2 days prior to this presentation.  he had been having intermittent chest pain with exertion that resolved with rest for the past month.  the morning of admission, he had [**8-13**] burning substernal chest pain with intermittent radiation to the left chest.  he came into the emergency department and was found to have st elecations inferiorly.  it was felt that he had collateral insufficiency given inferior st elevations in the setting of a known occluded right coronary.  given prior plans for medical management, he received aspirin, sublinqual nitro x 3, plavix 600 mg, heparin srip, lopressor, morphine and ativan.  his chest pain resolved in the emergency department, and he was transferedd to the ccu. upon arrival to the ccu, he complained of persistent burning substernal chest pain, and he ekg had persistent st elevations inferiorly with st elevations in v4 with right-sided leads.  he became acutely hypoxic to the 80s on a non-rebreather.  a bedside echocardiogram showed severely depressed left ventricular function with preserved right ventricular function. after discussions with his outpatient nephrologist, covering cardiologist, and daughters, he was taken emergently to the catherization lab for a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic catherization despite the risk of needing dialysis after the [**month/year (2) **] load.  he was emergently intubated.  he was started on pressors for cardiogenic shock.  catherization revealed severe stenosis at the left main trifucation.  a stent was placed to the proximal lad.  he was transfered to the ccu for further management.\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\n this

st-elevation myocardial infarction secondary to collateral insufficiency.  he was recently admitted to [**hospital1 18**] with complaints of chest pain and found to have significant cad based on a persantine mibi test, however a cardiac catheterization could not be performed given the severe acute on chronic renal failure.  this particular hospitalizations was complicated by multiple factors including cardiogenic shock, septic shock, repeated episodes of aspiration pna, and flash pulmonary edema. after his last episode of hypoxic respiratory failure and intubation/extubation, the pt was made dnr/dni after long discussions with the patient and his family.  soon after he was medically stabilized and transferred to out of the ccu.  however he suffered another episode of respiratory distress during which time he was made [**hospital1 3225**] after discussion with the patient and the hcp.  the details of the hospital course are summarized below. . . code status: prior to admission, the pt was living independently with intact adl and iadls.  however, this hospitalization for stemi was complicated by episodes of shock and hypoxic respiratory distress requiring intubation/extubation after which point the patient was made dnr/dni.  he was stabilized medically and called out of the icu on [**2124-5-8**].  however he experienced another episode of respiratory distress from pulmonary edema on the evening of [**2124-5-10**].  the following day, a family meeting was held with the patient and both the patient and the hcp agreed to become [**name (ni) 3225**].  he was subsequently transitioned off medical therapy and instead started on a morphine drip through a pre-existing picc line for comfort measures.  in addition, the pt was written for prn nebulizers and promethazine.  if needed, the pt should also receive a scopolamine patch. . . 1. stemi: his inferior infarction was attributed to collateral insufficiency.  initially, there was concern for right ventricular involvement.  however the right ventricle had preserved function on a bedside echocardiogram.  catherization confirmed severe 3 vessel disease.  at the time of catherization, ct surgery felt that he was not a surgical candidate given his multiple comorbidities.  therefore, he underwent stenting to the origin of the lad.  his cks peaked at 1351 and trended down post-intervention.  he was maintained on aspirin, plavix, and lipitor.  when he was weaned from pressors, he was started on a beta-blocker.  this was discontinued upon commencement of amiodarone.  after catheterization, the patient did not have any complaint of chest pain, nor did he have concerning ekg changes. . 2. hypoxic respiratory failure: his initial respiratory failure was likely secondary to cardiogenic shock in the setting of his st elevation myocardial infarction.  he required intubation prior to his catherization.  post-procedure, he developed copious amounts of dark thick sputum.  at that time, he developed a fever and a white count.  he was presumed to have an aspiration pneumonia as below.  he was maintained on the ventilator while he was on pressors for shock.  as his shock resolved, he became more hypertensive with elevated pulmonary artery pressures.  at that time, he had evidence of pulmonary edema.  he was diuresed prior to extubation.  he was successfully extubated on hospital day 7.  on hospital day 9, he had an episode of hypoxia in the setting of hypertension that was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.  a chest x-ray showed marked increased in bilateral pulmonary edema.  he received lasix and metolazone.  his symptoms improved with diuresis.  on [**5-5**] he developed respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema and likely aspiration pneumonia, which was treated with triple antibiotics. his pulmonary edema responded poorly to attempted diuresis. mental status waxed and waned but was generally declining and urine output poor in setting of aggressive diuresis. patient and family did not want to pursue dialysis. given poor prognosis decision was made with the family to move toward comfort care/hospice. . 3. shock: initially, he had evidence of cardiogenic shock with a low cardiac index on dopamine.  a balloon pump was placed at the time of catheterization and he was continued on dopamine.  a swan-ganz catheter was placed for hemodynamic monitoring.  on hospital day 3, he had evidence of septic shock give and elevated cardiac index with a low systemic vascular resistance. he had developed a fever to 101.3 and a white count of 22.  he did not respond to a cortisol stimulation test and was started on stress dose steroids.  he was started empirically of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and completed a 10 day course.  all cultures remained negative.  since his cardiac output had improved, the balloon pump was removed.  with the onset of the septic shock, he became more hypotensive.  therefore, levophed was started in addition to the dopamine.  over the next few days, he became afebrile, his white count trended down, and he was weaned from all pressors.  the swan-ganz catheter was subsequently removed.  he has remained hemodynamically stable since that time. . 4. atrial fibrillation: he intermittently went into atrial fibrillation.  on hospital day 9, he had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate with associated hypotension.  he was loaded with iv amiodarone.  subsequently, he dropped his pressures and became bradycardic.  he was transitioned to oral amiodarone and received 2 days of 400 [**hospital1 **] followed by 400 daily which at this point will be continued indefinitely. amiodarone was discontinued prior to discharge when decision was made to transition to comfort care. . 5. congestive heart failure: a post-intervention echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15%.  he initially had a balloon pump for support.  in the setting of septic shock, he became total body fluid overloaded and required diuresis with lasix. with improvement in his perfusion pressures, he began to autodiuresis.  he did go into flash pulmonary edema on [**5-5**] which eventually resolved. he has been difficult to diurese despite multiple attempts with agressive high dose diuretics. he continues to be total volume overloaded. he will be discharged on furosemide 60 mg po qd and with morphine for symptomatic control of dyspnea. . 6. end-stage renal disease: his renal function had been deteriorating prior to admission.  discussions were held with his nephrologist prior to taking him to the catherization lab. it was felt that the benefit of angiography with possible intervention outweighed the risk of contrast nephropathy. post-procedure, his creatinine trended down with adequate urine output.  on hospital day 3 with the onset of septic shock, his creatine began to rise.  this rise was likely from decreased renal perfusion.  as he was weaned off of the pressors and as his blood pressure improved, his urine output increased with a subsequent decrease in his creatinine.  dialysis was discussed with patient and family but this was not consistent with his known wishes. . 7. ileus: on admission, he had not had a bowel movement in 10 days.  plain films confirmed that his intestines were full of stool.  he received an aggressive bowel regimen.  after several days, a abdominal plain film showed dilated colonic loops.  an abdominal ct confirmed the dilated loops of bowel and showed no signs of obstruction.  surgery was consulted and felt that this was consisted with ileus likely secondary to the fentanyl during sedation.  he was decompressed with an ng tube to low suction and rectal tube.  repeat abdominal plain films showed no further dilatation.  once he was off of fentanyl sedation, his bowel sounds improved and he began to move his bowels.  he was maintained on bisacodyl suppositories. . 8. aortic stenosis: he has severe aortic stenosis with a gradient of 64 mmhg and a valve area of 0.9. volume status was carefully monitored given this setting. . 9. diabetes: his blood glucose was slightly elevated during the initial periods of septic shock.  at that time, he was maintained on an insulin sliding scale.  he was later well controlled and did not require any additional insulin. . 10. prophylaxis: he was maintained on subcutaneous heparin.  he was on a bowel regimen as above.  he was maintained on pantoprazole. . 11. access: he initially had a swan-ganz through his right femoral vein.  this was resited to the right internal jugular. the balloon pump was in the left femoral artery.  a radial arterial line was placed when the balloon pump was removed. once he was stable off of pressors, the swan and the central line were removed.  he had peripheral ivs. he will be discharged with picc line to facilitate morphine administration. . 12. fen: he was started on tube feeds on hospital day 3 as he was still intubated.  these were held in the setting of ileus. he was diuresed as above.  he was maintained on tube feeds.  as his mental status improved, he was evaluated for po intake. eventually he underwent video speech and swallow evaluation which revealed delayed laryngeal closure; it was recommended that he try ground solids and thickened liquids.  soon after beginning this, he had likely aspiration event leading to pna (see above).  after recovering from this, he was maintained on cautious po diet.  per family request, he was allowed to have thin liquids as well.  he continues to be at high risk for aspiration. .\",\n          \"Chief Complaint:\\n shortness of breath, fever\\n\\nHistory of Present Illness:\\n ms.

having intermittent chest pain with exertion that resolved with rest for the past month.  the morning of admission, he had [**8-13**] burning substernal chest pain with intermittent radiation to the left chest.  he came into the emergency department and was found to have st elecations inferiorly.  it was felt that he had collateral insufficiency given inferior st elevations in the setting of a known occluded right coronary.  given prior plans for medical management, he received aspirin, sublinqual nitro x 3, plavix 600 mg, heparin srip, lopressor, morphine and ativan.  his chest pain resolved in the emergency department, and he was transferedd to the ccu. upon arrival to the ccu, he complained of persistent burning substernal chest pain, and he ekg had persistent st elevations inferiorly with st elevations in v4 with right-sided leads.  he became acutely hypoxic to the 80s on a non-rebreather.  a bedside echocardiogram showed severely depressed left ventricular function with preserved right ventricular function. after discussions with his outpatient nephrologist, covering cardiologist, and daughters, he was taken emergently to the catherization lab for a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic catherization despite the risk of needing dialysis after the [**month/year (2) **] load.  he was emergently intubated.  he was started on pressors for cardiogenic shock.  catherization revealed severe stenosis at the left main trifucation.  a stent was placed to the proximal lad.  he was transfered to the ccu for further management.\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\n this

st-elevation myocardial infarction secondary to collateral insufficiency.  he was recently admitted to [**hospital1 18**] with complaints of chest pain and found to have significant cad based on a persantine mibi test, however a cardiac catheterization could not be performed given the severe acute on chronic renal failure.  this particular hospitalizations was complicated by multiple factors including cardiogenic shock, septic shock, repeated episodes of aspiration pna, and flash pulmonary edema. after his last episode of hypoxic respiratory failure and intubation/extubation, the pt was made dnr/dni after long discussions with the patient and his family.  soon after he was medically stabilized and transferred to out of the ccu.  however he suffered another episode of respiratory distress during which time he was made [**hospital1 3225**] after discussion with the patient and the hcp.  the details of the hospital course are summarized below. . . code status: prior to admission, the pt was living independently with intact adl and iadls.  however, this hospitalization for stemi was complicated by episodes of shock and hypoxic respiratory distress requiring intubation/extubation after which point the patient was made dnr/dni.  he was stabilized medically and called out of the icu on [**2124-5-8**].  however he experienced another episode of respiratory distress from pulmonary edema on the evening of [**2124-5-10**].  the following day, a family meeting was held with the patient and both the patient and the hcp agreed to become [**name (ni) 3225**].  he was subsequently transitioned off medical therapy and instead started on a morphine drip through a pre-existing picc line for comfort measures.  in addition, the pt was written for prn nebulizers and promethazine.  if needed, the pt should also receive a scopolamine patch. . . 1. stemi: his inferior infarction was attributed to collateral insufficiency.  initially, there was concern for right ventricular involvement.  however the right ventricle had preserved function on a bedside echocardiogram.  catherization confirmed severe 3 vessel disease.  at the time of catherization, ct surgery felt that he was not a surgical candidate given his multiple comorbidities.  therefore, he underwent stenting to the origin of the lad.  his cks peaked at 1351 and trended down post-intervention.  he was maintained on aspirin, plavix, and lipitor.  when he was weaned from pressors, he was started on a beta-blocker.  this was discontinued upon commencement of amiodarone.  after catheterization, the patient did not have any complaint of chest pain, nor did he have concerning ekg changes. . 2. hypoxic respiratory failure: his initial respiratory failure was likely secondary to cardiogenic shock in the setting of his st elevation myocardial infarction.  he required intubation prior to his catherization.  post-procedure, he developed copious amounts of dark thick sputum.  at that time, he developed a fever and a white count.  he was presumed to have an aspiration pneumonia as below.  he was maintained on the ventilator while he was on pressors for shock.  as his shock resolved, he became more hypertensive with elevated pulmonary artery pressures.  at that time, he had evidence of pulmonary edema.  he was diuresed prior to extubation.  he was successfully extubated on hospital day 7.  on hospital day 9, he had an episode of hypoxia in the setting of hypertension that was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.  a chest x-ray showed marked increased in bilateral pulmonary edema.  he received lasix and metolazone.  his symptoms improved with diuresis.  on [**5-5**] he developed respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema and likely aspiration pneumonia, which was treated with triple antibiotics. his pulmonary edema responded poorly to attempted diuresis. mental status waxed and waned but was generally declining and urine output poor in setting of aggressive diuresis. patient and family did not want to pursue dialysis. given poor prognosis decision was made with the family to move toward comfort care/hospice. . 3. shock: initially, he had evidence of cardiogenic shock with a low cardiac index on dopamine.  a balloon pump was placed at the time of catheterization and he was continued on dopamine.  a swan-ganz catheter was placed for hemodynamic monitoring.  on hospital day 3, he had evidence of septic shock give and elevated cardiac index with a low systemic vascular resistance. he had developed a fever to 101.3 and a white count of 22.  he did not respond to a cortisol stimulation test and was started on stress dose steroids.  he was started empirically of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and completed a 10 day course.  all cultures remained negative.  since his cardiac output had improved, the balloon pump was removed.  with the onset of the septic shock, he became more hypotensive.  therefore, levophed was started in addition to the dopamine.  over the next few days, he became afebrile, his white count trended down, and he was weaned from all pressors.  the swan-ganz catheter was subsequently removed.  he has remained hemodynamically stable since that time. . 4. atrial fibrillation: he intermittently went into atrial fibrillation.  on hospital day 9, he had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate with associated hypotension.  he was loaded with iv amiodarone.  subsequently, he dropped his pressures and became bradycardic.  he was transitioned to oral amiodarone and received 2 days of 400 [**hospital1 **] followed by 400 daily which at this point will be continued indefinitely. amiodarone was discontinued prior to discharge when decision was made to transition to comfort care. . 5. congestive heart failure: a post-intervention echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15%.  he initially had a balloon pump for support.  in the setting of septic shock, he became total body fluid overloaded and required diuresis with lasix. with improvement in his perfusion pressures, he began to autodiuresis.  he did go into flash pulmonary edema on [**5-5**] which eventually resolved. he has been difficult to diurese despite multiple attempts with agressive high dose diuretics. he continues to be total volume overloaded. he will be discharged on furosemide 60 mg po qd and with morphine for symptomatic control of dyspnea. . 6. end-stage renal disease: his renal function had been deteriorating prior to admission.  discussions were held with his nephrologist prior to taking him to the catherization lab. it was felt that the benefit of angiography with possible intervention outweighed the risk of contrast nephropathy. post-procedure, his creatinine trended down with adequate urine output.  on hospital day 3 with the onset of septic shock, his creatine began to rise.  this rise was likely from decreased renal perfusion.  as he was weaned off of the pressors and as his blood pressure improved, his urine output increased with a subsequent decrease in his creatinine.  dialysis was discussed with patient and family but this was not consistent with his known wishes. . 7. ileus: on admission, he had not had a bowel movement in 10 days.  plain films confirmed that his intestines were full of stool.  he received an aggressive bowel regimen.  after several days, a abdominal plain film showed dilated colonic loops.  an abdominal ct confirmed the dilated loops of bowel and showed no signs of obstruction.  surgery was consulted and felt that this was consisted with ileus likely secondary to the fentanyl during sedation.  he was decompressed with an ng tube to low suction and rectal tube.  repeat abdominal plain films showed no further dilatation.  once he was off of fentanyl sedation, his bowel sounds improved and he began to move his bowels.  he was maintained on bisacodyl suppositories. . 8. aortic stenosis: he has severe aortic stenosis with a gradient of 64 mmhg and a valve area of 0.9. volume status was carefully monitored given this setting. . 9. diabetes: his blood glucose was slightly elevated during the initial periods of septic shock.  at that time, he was maintained on an insulin sliding scale.  he was later well controlled and did not require any additional insulin. . 10. prophylaxis: he was maintained on subcutaneous heparin.  he was on a bowel regimen as above.  he was maintained on pantoprazole. . 11. access: he initially had a swan-ganz through his right femoral vein.  this was resited to the right internal jugular. the balloon pump was in the left femoral artery.  a radial arterial line was placed when the balloon pump was removed. once he was stable off of pressors, the swan and the central line were removed.  he had peripheral ivs. he will be discharged with picc line to facilitate morphine administration. . 12. fen: he was started on tube feeds on hospital day 3 as he was still intubated.  these were held in the setting of ileus. he was diuresed as above.  he was maintained on tube feeds.  as his mental status improved, he was evaluated for po intake. eventually he underwent video speech and swallow evaluation which revealed delayed laryngeal closure; it was recommended that he try ground solids and thickened liquids.  soon after beginning this, he had likely aspiration event leading to pna (see above).  after recovering from this, he was maintained on cautious po diet.  per family request, he was allowed to have thin liquids as well.  he continues to be at high risk for aspiration. .\",\n          \"Chief Complaint:\\n shortness of breath, fever\\n\\nHistory of Present Illness:\\n ms.

\"Chief Complaint:\\n chest pain\\n\\nHistory of Present Illness:\\n    this is an 87 year-old male with history of 3 vessel coronary disease, congestive heart failure, aortic stenosis, diabetes, end-stage renal disease not on dialysis who presents with st elevation infarction.  he was recently admitted with unstable angina and was discharged 2 days prior to this presentation.  he had been having intermittent chest pain with exertion that resolved with rest for the past month.  the morning of admission, he had [**8-13**] burning substernal chest pain with intermittent radiation to the left chest.  he came into the emergency department and was found to have st elecations inferiorly.  it was felt that he had collateral insufficiency given inferior st elevations in the setting of a known occluded right coronary.  given prior plans for medical management, he received aspirin, sublinqual nitro x 3, plavix 600 mg, heparin srip, lopressor, morphine and ativan.  his chest pain resolved in the emergency department, and he was transferedd to the ccu. upon arrival to the ccu, he complained of persistent burning substernal chest pain, and he ekg had persistent st elevations inferiorly with st elevations in v4 with right-sided leads.  he became acutely hypoxic to the 80s on a non-rebreather.  a bedside echocardiogram showed severely depressed left ventricular function with preserved right ventricular function. after discussions with his outpatient nephrologist, covering cardiologist, and daughters, he was taken emergently to the catherization lab for a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic catherization despite the risk of needing dialysis after the [**month/year (2) **] load.  he was emergently intubated.  he was started on pressors for cardiogenic shock.  catherization revealed severe stenosis at the left main trifucation.  a stent was placed to the proximal lad.  he was transfered to the ccu for further management.\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\n this is an 87 year-old gentleman with known 3 vessel coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure ef 25%, aortic stenosis ([**location (un) 109**] 0.9 cm2), diabetes who presented with an inferior st-elevation myocardial infarction secondary to collateral insufficiency.  he was recently admitted to [**hospital1 18**] with complaints of chest pain and found to have significant cad based on a persantine mibi test, however a cardiac catheterization could not be performed given the severe acute on chronic renal failure.  this particular hospitalizations was complicated by multiple factors including cardiogenic shock, septic shock, repeated episodes of aspiration pna, and flash pulmonary edema. after his last episode of hypoxic respiratory failure and intubation/extubation, the pt was made dnr/dni after long discussions with the patient and his family.  soon after he was medically stabilized and transferred to out of the ccu.  however he suffered another episode of respiratory distress during which time he was made [**hospital1 3225**] after discussion with the patient and the hcp.  the details of the hospital course are summarized below. . . code status: prior to admission, the pt was living independently with intact adl and iadls.  however, this hospitalization for stemi was complicated by episodes of shock and hypoxic respiratory distress requiring intubation/extubation after which point the patient was made dnr/dni.  he was stabilized medically and called out of the icu on [**2124-5-8**].  however he experienced another episode of respiratory distress from pulmonary edema on the evening of [**2124-5-10**].  the following day, a family meeting was held with the patient and both the patient and the hcp agreed to become [**name (ni) 3225**].  he was subsequently transitioned off medical therapy and instead started on a morphine drip through a pre-existing picc line for comfort measures.  in addition, the pt was written for prn nebulizers and promethazine.  if needed, the pt should also receive a scopolamine patch. . . 1. stemi: his inferior infarction was attributed to collateral insufficiency.  initially, there was concern for right ventricular involvement.  however the right ventricle had preserved function on a bedside echocardiogram.  catherization confirmed severe 3 vessel disease.  at the time of catherization, ct surgery felt that he was not a surgical candidate given his multiple comorbidities.  therefore, he underwent stenting to the origin of the lad.  his cks peaked at 1351 and trended down post-intervention.  he was maintained on aspirin, plavix, and lipitor.  when he was weaned from pressors, he was started on a beta-blocker.  this was discontinued upon commencement of amiodarone.  after catheterization, the patient did not have any complaint of chest pain, nor did he have concerning ekg changes. . 2. hypoxic respiratory failure: his initial respiratory failure was likely secondary to cardiogenic shock in the setting of his st elevation myocardial infarction.  he required intubation prior to his catherization.  post-procedure, he developed copious amounts of dark thick sputum.  at that time, he developed a fever and a white count.  he was presumed to have an aspiration pneumonia as below.  he was maintained on the ventilator while he was on pressors for shock.  as his shock resolved, he became more hypertensive with elevated pulmonary artery pressures.  at that time, he had evidence of pulmonary edema.  he was diuresed prior to extubation.  he was successfully extubated on hospital day 7.  on hospital day 9, he had an episode of hypoxia in the setting of hypertension that was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.  a chest x-ray showed marked increased in bilateral pulmonary edema.  he received lasix and metolazone.  his symptoms improved with diuresis.  on [**5-5**] he developed respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema and likely aspiration pneumonia, which was treated with triple antibiotics. his pulmonary edema responded poorly to attempted diuresis. mental status waxed and waned but was generally declining and urine output poor in setting of aggressive diuresis. patient and family did not want to pursue dialysis. given poor prognosis decision was made with the family to move toward comfort care/hospice. . 3. shock: initially, he had evidence of cardiogenic shock with a low cardiac index on dopamine.  a balloon pump was placed at the time of catheterization and he was continued on dopamine.  a swan-ganz catheter was placed for hemodynamic monitoring.  on hospital day 3, he had evidence of septic shock give and elevated cardiac index with a low systemic vascular resistance. he had developed a fever to 101.3 and a white count of 22.  he did not respond to a cortisol stimulation test and was started on stress dose steroids.  he was started empirically of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and completed a 10 day course.  all cultures remained negative.  since his cardiac output had improved, the balloon pump was removed.  with the onset of the septic shock, he became more hypotensive.  therefore, levophed was started in addition to the dopamine.  over the next few days, he became afebrile, his white count trended down, and he was weaned from all pressors.  the swan-ganz catheter was subsequently removed.  he has remained hemodynamically stable since that time. . 4. atrial fibrillation: he intermittently went into atrial fibrillation.  on hospital day 9, he had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate with associated hypotension.  he was loaded with iv amiodarone.  subsequently, he dropped his pressures and became bradycardic.  he was transitioned to oral amiodarone and received 2 days of 400 [**hospital1 **] followed by 400 daily which at this point will be continued indefinitely. amiodarone was discontinued prior to discharge when decision was made to transition to comfort care. . 5. congestive heart failure: a post-intervention echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15%.  he initially had a balloon pump for support.  in the setting of septic shock, he became total body fluid overloaded and required diuresis with lasix. with improvement in his perfusion pressures, he began to autodiuresis.  he did go into flash pulmonary edema on [**5-5**] which eventually resolved. he has been difficult to diurese despite multiple attempts with agressive high dose diuretics. he continues to be total volume overloaded. he will be discharged on furosemide 60 mg po qd and with morphine for symptomatic control of dyspnea. . 6. end-stage renal disease: his renal function had been deteriorating prior to admission.  discussions were held with his nephrologist prior to taking him to the catherization lab. it was felt that the benefit of angiography with possible intervention outweighed the risk of contrast nephropathy. post-procedure, his creatinine trended down with adequate urine output.  on hospital day 3 with the onset of septic shock, his creatine began to rise.  this rise was likely from decreased renal perfusion.  as he was weaned off of the pressors and as his blood pressure improved, his urine output increased with a subsequent decrease in his creatinine.  dialysis was discussed with patient and family but this was not consistent with his known wishes. . 7. ileus: on admission, he had not had a bowel movement in 10 days.  plain films confirmed that his intestines were full of stool.  he received an aggressive bowel regimen.  after several days, a abdominal plain film showed dilated colonic loops.  an abdominal ct confirmed the dilated loops of bowel and showed no signs of obstruction.  surgery was consulted and felt that this was consisted with ileus likely secondary to the fentanyl during sedation.  he was decompressed with an ng tube to low suction and rectal tube.  repeat abdominal plain films showed no further dilatation.  once he was off of fentanyl sedation, his bowel sounds improved and he began to move his bowels.  he was maintained on bisacodyl suppositories. . 8. aortic stenosis: he has severe aortic stenosis with a gradient of 64 mmhg and a valve area of 0.9. volume status was carefully monitored given this setting. . 9. diabetes: his blood glucose was slightly elevated during the initial periods of septic shock.  at that time, he was maintained on an insulin sliding scale.  he was later well controlled and did not require any additional insulin. . 10. prophylaxis: he was maintained on subcutaneous heparin.  he was on a bowel regimen as above.  he was maintained on pantoprazole. . 11. access: he initially had a swan-ganz through his right femoral vein.  this was resited to the right internal jugular. the balloon pump was in the left femoral artery.  a radial arterial line was placed when the balloon pump was removed. once he was stable off of pressors, the swan and the central line were removed.  he had peripheral ivs. he will be discharged with picc line to facilitate morphine administration. . 12. fen: he was started on tube feeds on hospital day 3 as he was still intubated.  these were held in the setting of ileus. he was diuresed as above.  he was maintained on tube feeds.  as his mental status improved, he was evaluated for po intake. eventually he underwent video speech and swallow evaluation which revealed delayed laryngeal closure; it was recommended that he try ground solids and thickened liquids.  soon after beginning this, he had likely aspiration event leading to pna (see above).  after recovering from this, he was maintained on cautious po diet.  per family request, he was allowed to have thin liquids as well.  he continues to be at high risk for aspiration. .\",\n          \"Chief Complaint:\\n shortness of breath, fever\\n\\nHistory of Present Illness:\\n ms.

This is mainly due to the lack of consistency in symptoms and the presence of multiple variables involved in the clustering process. The symptoms listed in the data are extremely heterogeneous and can indicate a wide range of potential disorders. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to group the data into clusters representing specific medical conditions.\n","\n","Furthermore, symptom overlap and individual variability further contribute to the challenge of identifying clear patterns in the data. Many symptoms can be present in multiple medical conditions, while patient responses to symptoms can vary significantly from individual to individual.\n","\n","It should be noted that, although it may be possible to identify more defined patterns in a smaller cluster (as was possible, to some extent, by implementing the algorithm on the KINBIOTICS_NER dataset), as the number of symptoms increases (in this dataset we counted 13449), it becomes more difficult to group the data into coherent and meaningful clusters.\n","\n","In conclusion, it is important to consider the challenges and limitations encountered during the clustering process when using data analysis techniques related to health.
