Brief Hospital Course:
 mr. [**known firstname 4884**] [**known lastname 6164**] is a 70-year-old man with multiple myeloma and plasma cell leukemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, dm type 2, who presents with fever and neutropenia. he had recently received outpatient chemotherapy with velcade on [**2173-7-26**]. . # fever with neutropenia: in the ed, the patient had a temperature of 102.9 with a wbc count of 21.1 with 1% neutrophils (anc ~210). there were no localizing signs of infection on examination. cxr was negative in the ed. he was treated empirically with 1x vancomycin, 1x levaquin and 1x cefepime. on the floor, antibiotic coverage was changed to iv cefepime to cover gi organisms and pseudomonas. the patient remained febrile and therefore acyclovir was added since the patient was recently admitted with disseminated zoster. the lesions on his body, however, appeared to be healing. the patient still remained febrile and vancomycin and azithromycin were added as per id consultation. on [**2173-7-28**] the patient became progressively tachypneic to the 30s, sbp 140-150s, increasingly tachycardic to the 140s, diaphoretic with o2 saturation of 99% on 1l. ekg showed sinus tachycardia with no evidence of ischemia, cardiac enzymes were negative x 1. he continued to have high grade temperatures as high as 103 f. blood cultures just grew gram positive cocci in clusters. he is transferred to [**hospital unit name 153**] for closer monitoring for sepsis/sirs. in the icu, antifungal therapy was started with caspofungin. a rij central line was placed for better access. initial cxr was negative for any infiltrate. repeat cxr the next day revealed a right lower lobe pneumonia. ct scan was then obtained which showed two focal areas of consolidation, one in the left upper lobe and the other in the right lower lobe, which demonstrate a surrounding ground-glass appearance, most consistent with invasive aspergillosis. treatment was then initiated with iv voriconazole and caspofungin was discontinued. the patient then stabilized in the icu and was transferred back to the floor on [**2173-7-30**]. the patient continued to have low grade fevers and baseline tachycardia. his wbc count remained low with anc between 300-400. pulmonary evaluation was obtained to evaluate the possibility of doing a bronchoscopy for the purpose of getting a tissue diagnosis according to the recommendations of infectious diseases. pulmonary felt that treatment would be continued despite a negative biopsy and therefore the risk of undergoing such a procedure was considered too risky given his degree of neutropenia. blood cultures were subsequently all negative. since the patient was responding to treatment, voriconazole was continued po, acyclovir was continued at prophylactic doses po, vancomycin was discontinued and levaquin po was added for a two week time course. the patient was discharged on this regimen. follow up ct scan in two weeks was ordered and the patient was scheduled to follow up with dr. [**last name (stitle) **] in the pulmonary clinic. upon discharge the patient was persistently neutropenic. this was considered his baseline due to severe and progressive involvement of his bone marrow. g-csf was not thought to be of any use given the degree of bone marrow invasion. on discharge he had been afebrile for more than 3 days and was markedly improved clinically with stable vital signs. . # respiratory alkalosis/metabolic acidosis: on admission the patient was noted to have a low bicarbonate level of 16 that later dropped further to 12 on [**7-28**] when the patient was evaluated by the icu team. abg at the time revealed a respiratory alkalosis with a ph of 7.49, pco2 17 with a concomitant non gap metabolic acidosis. this was thought to be secondary to tachypneic secondary to sepsis and his underlying pulmonary infection. in addition, the patient was thought to have renal tubular acidosis either secondary to his multiple myeloma (proximal rta) or due to chronic renal failure with a persistently low bicarbonate on previous admissions. with improvement in his respiratory status, repeat blood gases showed a neutral ph and his bicarbonate began to rise steadily up to 17 on discharge, likely due to his resolving pulmonary infection. once back on the floor, formal renal consultation was obtained for further evaluation and guidance in treatment. no treatment was necessary since the patient's acid-base status improved on its own with treatment of his underlying disease. . # mm/plasma cell leukemia: the patient had been receiving chemotherapy up until this admission with the last dose given on [**2173-7-26**]. during his hospital stay no chemotherapy was given due to his complicated hospital course with persistent neutropenia. a portocath was placed the day prior to discharge and the patient was advised to follow up in clinic for possible future treatments. it is unlikely that he will be able to tolerate velcade again and other treatments will have to be explored. his last dose of chemotherapy was on [**7-26**]. . # thrombocytopenia/anemia - thought to be secondary to bone marrow invasion of plasma cells with concomitant chemotherapeutic effects. mr. [**known lastname 6164**] received multiple transfusions of both platelets and prbcs in order to maintain his counts. no asa or heparin was given while in hospital except for minimal amounts of heparin to flush central lines. upon discharge his hct was 26.4 and his plts were 81k. . # chronic renal insufficiency: the patient has a baseline cr of [**1-21**]. medications were dosed according to his renal function. upon discharge his cr. was 1.1. . # htn - patient was hypotensive in the ed requiring fluid boluses, on the floor he remained borderline hypotensive requiring ivf. after stabilization the patient had a stable blood pressure and did not require any antihypertensive medications. . # dm - the patient was monitored throughout his stay with qid finger sticks with sliding scale insulin. the patient did not require insulin and his glucose values where consistently within normal limits. on the last two days of admission, finger sticks and insulin were discontinued. he was discharged without any oral hypoglycemics. . # hyperlipidemia - lipitor was held during this admission. . # ppx - neutropenic precautions, bowel regimen, no heparin due to low plts",949,"[{""start"": 7177, ""end"": 7182, ""text"": ""bowel"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 436, ""end"": 444, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 449, ""end"": 456, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2886, ""end"": 2890, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3144, ""end"": 3148, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 6640, ""end"": 6644, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 449, ""end"": 456, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 4750, ""end"": 4757, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 4847, ""end"": 4854, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 5150, ""end"": 5157, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 6344, ""end"": 6351, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 6450, ""end"": 6457, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 813, ""end"": 818, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2397, ""end"": 2403, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 5627, ""end"": 5631, ""text"": ""cath"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 2078, ""end"": 2085, ""text"": ""cardiac"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3204, ""end"": 3210, ""text"": ""tissue"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 4266, ""end"": 4277, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 4503, ""end"": 4514, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 4946, ""end"": 4957, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2530, ""end"": 2539, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3162, ""end"": 3168, ""text"": ""bronch"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3089, ""end"": 3098, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3278, ""end"": 3287, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3894, ""end"": 3903, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 4685, ""end"": 4694, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 5099, ""end"": 5108, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 398, ""end"": 403, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1899, ""end"": 1909, ""text"": ""tachypneic"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 4635, ""end"": 4645, ""text"": ""tachypneic"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Urosepsis"", ""Respiratory""]}",4,910,2023-05-23T11:08:02.429144Z,2023-05-23T11:08:02.429174Z,33.39

developed recurrent sepsis. . # sepsis: patient had previously had an e. coli and citrobacter pneumonia and had been treated with 15 days of levofloxacin ending on [**2126-10-3**].  he then developed new fevers and hypotension on [**2126-10-5**].  he had no leukocytosis, and sources of his fever included a re-current pnuemonia, urinary tract infection, line infection, c. difficile colitis, and acalculous cholecystitis. it was also possible that it could have been cardiac in nature, though repeat ekg showed no new findings since admission; his cardiac enzymes bumped slightly, but this was thought to be likely secondary to acute renal faliure. additionally, previous tte showed adequate cardiac function. - vancomycin was re-started for mrsa coverage, meropenem for gram negative coverage as patient could have esbl klebs from prolonged hospital stay, flagyl to prophylactically treat c. difficile. - cultures were drawn and followed. - stress dose steroids were re-started. - pressors

to evaluate for pe was held due to concern for arf. with further imaging, localized consolidation and bilateral effusions suggest more infectious cause, and pt was emperically treated with levo and zosyn. pna was confirmed by gnr on sputum culture - citrobacter and e coli, both sensitive to ciprofloxacin, so zosyn was stopped and levofloxacin was continued for a total of 15 days. . initially, plans were being made for placement of a tracheostomy, however once patient developed recurrent sepsis, care was withdrawn as noted above. . #) acute renal failure in setting of cadaveric transplant: initial epsiode of arf likely combination of pre-renal effects of hypotension and nephrotoxicity of elevated prograft levels. arf likely pre-renal in nature given hypotension and shock. u/s done previously this stay within normal limits.  urine eos negative, and urine electrolytes unrevealing.  on [**9-21**] prograft level found to be greatly elevated, and prograft was held for 4 days, then restarted.  pt had medabolic acidosis, which was treated with iv bicarb to attempt to decrease respiratory rate. creatinine returned to [**location 25620**] of 1.7-19.  in setting of reoccurance of shock on [**10-5**], creatinine again increased to 2.5.  elevated creatinine was likely prerenal in the setting of hypotension and pressors . the renal team followed along and made recommendations regarding the dosing of his cellcept, bactrim, and other medications. . #) thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy:  coagulopathy was felt to be likely precipitated by sepsis picture. platelets decreased [**9-23**] and pt, ptt, inr elevated.  hit was negative, but all heparin products were stopped, except given schistocytes seen on peripheral smear concern for dic vs ttp.  fibrinogen was checked and was initially <100 (64), but elevated.  fdp was elevated as was the d-dimer and ldh.  habtoglobin was normal, and coumbs was negative.  heme consulted, felt ttp was unlikely given small amount of schistocytes, and that cause was multifactorial. causes include sepsis/shock, transfusion related, medication induced, idiopathic. overtime, both coagulation and thrombocytopenia trended back towards normal and dic labs tranded downwards as well.  heparin sq was restarted without further thrombocytopenia.  with recurrent sepsis on [**10-5**], platlets decreased again . #) mental status changes: staff and wards team noted possible change in mental status around time of hypoxia and sob. given the events of the evening, it is possible that those accounted for his mental status changes. since his arrival at the micu, it has been difficult to assess mental status, but at baseline he is pleasant and aware of recent events.  head ct showed possible l parital occiptal infarct, which neurology feels is likely unrelated.  tsh was checked, and only slightly elevated at 5.5. as sedation was weaned off and pt had increased responsiveness.",945,"[{""start"": 771, ""end"": 780, ""text"":

Brief Hospital Course:
 in summary, patient is a 62 y/o lady with h/o alcohol abuse, c.diff colitis, also s/p colectomy in [**4-8**] with small pelvic abscess,  admitted on [**2132-12-10**] for placement after being found intoxicated in her apartment, found lying in her feces, unable to care for herself per family. on admission patient was found to have low blood pressures 80/40s in the ed, given ns ~3l with little improvement. on the floor the patient remained hypotensive with bp ranging 80-110s/40-60s. she triggered twice for hypotension but responded to fluid boluses. patient remained asymptomatic throughout. patient was also being worked up for proximal right leg weakness and the w/up was negative including pelvic ct scan and emg. patient also found to have a pansensitive klebisella uti and completed a course of cipro x 7 days.patient was also being evaluated by gi for chronic diarrhea. she was admitted on po vanco for recurrent c.diff but was c.diff negative x 3 during this admission. as such, vanco was discontinued. gi was intending to do colonsocopy but this was deferred due to episodes of tachycardia and one episode of nsvt. ekgs showed low voltage but no other significant changes. patient also had two echos done which showed normal ef, no pericardial effusions. in terms of her hypotension, she had a random cortisol level and stim that were wnl and therefore was not started on steroids. . on [**2132-12-20**] patient again became hypotensive to 80s/doppler which again responded to fluids. patient later spiked a temperature of 102.4 and later desaturated to 83% on ra. inr was up to 3.4 and was previously normal. she was treated empirically with vanco, levo, and flagyl and transferred to micu. . in micu, patient was initially treated with vanco, zosyn, and flagyl. cxr showed b/l pleural effusion. patient remained stable w/out a clear source of infection. zosyn was stopped on [**12-22**]. she is now transferred to the floor on po vanco/flagyl for presumed c.diff infection. . upon transfer to the floor: patient was transferred on 5 nc sating >95%. patient later desated to low 80s and o2 increased to 6l, patient later weaned on 4l, now sating 97%. patient also had 2 episodes of frankly blood stool. hct dropped from 34->28. vss. patient treated with zosyn and po vanco for presumed pneumonia and c.diff. patient initially doing well, alert, no complaints. later that evening patient went into what was thought to be v-tach with hr to 190s, patient continued to mentate, bp dropped to 70-80s/doppler. loaded with iv amiodarone with conversion to sr (hr 90s) and transferred to the micu again. cards/ep evaluation felt that this was v-tach as well but subsequently felt that this was svt with aberrancy. amio was d/ced and patient was put on beta blocker with good hr control. patient was called out from icu [**2132-12-23**]. [**12-23**] evening, patient had gib w/crit drop from 34 to 28, spont increased am [**12-25**] to 30 in am and 32.5 at noon.  the same evening, the patient was found to be sob by rn then quickly converted to vtach @ 194 w/pressure 89/50 not substantially changed from floor baseline. pt's mental status was good throughout episode. pt spontaneously converted to sinus and was transferred to micu briefly. patient was treated empirically with steroids for oingoing low blood pressure. thoracentesis was also perforemed which showed a transudative effusion. patient was then diuresed with lasix. patient continued to be followed by cardiology, continued on beta blocker with good hr control. patient continued treatment for c. difficile colitis with flagyl/vancomycin. patient has remained stable over the last week maintaining good blood pressure, mentating well, diarrhea decreasing although still loose, afebrile, hr under good control. her nutritional status is also improved and she is consuming a po diet with supplementation. her magnesium level remains low however she is receiving [**month/year (2) **] repletion. would recommend long acting magnesium if able to get at the nursing home (this was not available through the hospital pharmacy). ekgs have been showing a prolonged qt interval. patient was evaluated by cardiology again who could not find an exact mechanisms. flagyl was discontinued given a few reported cases of prolonged qt syndrome with this medication. all other medications do not produce prolonged qt. the best explanation is her persistently low magnesium which must be continuously repleted and improvement in her nutritional status. ct head was performed to r/out bleed. this was negative. other testing was performed including anti-ro/[**name prefix (prefixes) **] [**last name (prefixes) 32545**] which are pending at the time of discharge. patient was refusing all other testing at the time of discharged and requested to leave the hospital and go to the nursing home without further intervention. she will need close pcp follow up and possibly cardiology follow up as an outpatient. patient's hct is also slightly low however she is not gi bleeding and she is scheduled for gi follow up. patient likely requires a colonoscopy in the near future. her lab studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease. patient was guiac negative on discharge. hct stable at 30. . in terms of her individual problems: . # sepsis. likely secondary to chronic c.diff, found to be positive for toxin b on [**12-20**], diarrhea improving, still on po vanco and flagyl to continue until gi follow up. wbc down to wnl. afebrile. . # svt with aberrancy/prolonged qt on ekg. on metoprolol 37.5mg [**hospital1 **]. no further episodes. hr well controlled.  continue beta blocker at current dose. likely will need cardiology follow up in future to be arranged by pcp.  [**name10 (nameis) **] electrolyte repletion required for prolonged qt. . # chronic diarrhea. secondary to c.diff, toxin b positive. on antibiotic treatment as above.  continue ppi. . # hypotension: secondary to intravascular volume depletion [**2-5**] to diarrhea, poor po intake, hypoalbuminemia. currently stable with ongoing treatment of underlying infection.  patient received a tapering dose of steroids completed on [**2133-1-11**]. . # anasarca: unclear etiology, likely in part due to very poor nutritional status, long hx of etoh abuse, hypoalbuminemia. tolerating diuresis with stable bp. upon discharge her le edema was completely resolved, lung clear to auscultation which was significantly improved. she is discharged on 20 mg of lasix daily. continue lasix as blood pressure tolerates along with daily weights. patient scheduled for pcp follow up, chemistries should be repeated in two days and results sent to pcp or physician at rehab. continue fluid restriction 1500ml. . # anemia: macrocytic anemia [**2-5**] etoh as well as anemia of chronic disease based on iron studies, elevated b12, nl folate;

Brief Hospital Course:
 mr. [**known lastname **] is a 53 year old man with a history of polycystic kidney disease with cadaveric renal transplant in [**2147**], esophageal and gastric varices s/p banding procedures (last 3wks prior to admission) who was transferred from an outside hospital to [**hospital1 18**] micu for hypotension and fever. . # fever: the patient initially presented to [**hospital **] hospital with a clinical picture resembling sepsis (hypotension, fever, rigors). he received stress dose steroids and vancomycin, ceftriaxone at the outside hospital and was transferred to the [**hospital1 18**] micu where the patient was afebrile with blood pressures ranging in the 90-100's/60-70's and patient's blood pressure then improved with intravenous fluids. the patient had blood cultures with no growth and a urine culture that showed ~1000/ml staph species. ultrasound of the transplanted kidney was normal. the likely source of the patient's infectious presentation was infectious diarrhea. since the patient had received antibiotics during a recent admission for bleeding varices, c. diff was considered most likely the cause of the patient's brief septic episode. assay for c. diff was negative on three separate samples, and fecal culture and cmv viral load were negative. the patient's diarrhea improved with empiric metronidazole therapy and with discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil. after the patient had been afebrile and culture-negative for 48 hours vancomycin and cefepime were discontinued, which the patient tolerated well. the patient was discharged with a course of metronidazole. . # acute on chronic renal failure: the patient has known chronic kidney disease as well as a renal transplant. the patient's increase in creatinine was likely due to a prerenal etiology in the setting of septic physiology and hypotension. the patient's renal function improved to near the baseline creatinine of 2 with intravenous fluids. the nephrology consult service followed the patient and recommended holding mycophenolate mofetil as it is a known cause of chronic diarrhea, and increasing the patient's prednisone. cyclosporine was continued and daily cyclosporine levels were monitored. . # portal hypertension: the patient has known esophageal and gastric varices and had a recent admission for emergent banding of varices. during this admission the patient was followed by the liver consult service and the patient had a repeat egd and had banding of varices again. interventional radiology was asked to comment on whether a tips procedure would be feasible in this patient given the multple hepatic cysts seen on ultrasound and ir stated that they would consider tips but would require a ct with contrast of the abdomen, which, in the setting of this patient's poor renal function, would present another potential kidney injury. the patient was discharged with a plan to follow up with his primary care doctor as well as have a repeat egd approximately three weeks post-discharge. . # pancytopenia: the patient is on chronic immunsuppression for his renal transplant, but had worse anemia and thrombocytopenia on this admission. the patient was guaiac negative and hemolysis labs were normal. through his icu course the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 23 with an appropriate bump in his hct to 26. he also received one platelet transfusion, but had some additional worsened thrombocytopenia while on the floor that was attributed to increased splenic sequestration in the setting of sepsis. the patient's platelets improved over the course of admission and he did not require additional transfusions. . # ectopy on cardiac telemetry: during his hospitalization the patient was noted to have episodes of frequent pvc's and trigeminy on telemetry. this was thought to be due to having been taken off his home beta-blocker while septic in the micu and nadolol was re-started on the floor. the patient had a trans-thoracic echocardiogram while admitted to evaluate for possibility of vegetations. the echo did not reveal any vegetations and the patient was discharged on his home dose of nadolol.",933,"[{""start"": 4526, ""end"": 4533, ""text"": ""abdomen"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 1379, ""end"": 1384, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 18, ""end"": 26, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 546, ""end"": 554, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1342, ""end"": 1350, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2783, ""end"": 2791, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 3092, ""end"": 3100, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 3874, ""end"": 3882, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 152, ""end"": 159, ""text"": ""gastric"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1957, ""end"": 1964, ""text"": ""gastric"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 4060, ""end"": 4067, ""text"": ""gastric"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1669, ""end"": 1676, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 4190, ""end"": 4195, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 5822, ""end"": 5826, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 1669, ""end"": 1676, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 76, ""end"": 82, ""text"": ""kidney"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1880, ""end"": 1886, ""text"": ""kidney"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2690, ""end"": 2696, ""text"": ""kidney"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3468, ""end"": 3474, ""text"": ""kidney"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 4628, ""end"": 4634, ""text"": ""kidney"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 104, ""end"": 111, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 808, ""end"": 815, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1909, ""end"": 1916, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3422, ""end"": 3429, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3495, ""end"": 3502, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3655, ""end"": 3662, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 4579, ""end"": 4586, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 4863, ""end"": 4870, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2609, ""end"": 2614, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 5467, ""end"": 5474, ""text"": ""cardiac"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 5775, ""end"": 5781, ""text"": ""cardio"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1636, ""end"": 1641, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 5659, ""end"": 5663, ""text"": ""beta"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1699, ""end"": 1707, ""text"": ""swelling"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1709, ""end"": 1713, ""text"": ""numb"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1689, ""end"": 1692, ""text"": ""leg"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 644, ""end"": 655, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1217, ""end"": 1228, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 625, ""end"": 634, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 678, ""end"": 683, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1610, ""end"": 1615, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1648, ""end"": 1667, ""text"": ""shortness of breath"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1186, ""end"": 1189, ""text"": ""pna"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,Urosepsis,"{""choices"": [""Gastrointestinal"", ""Endocarditis""]}",4,894,2023-05-23T10:59:54.351175Z,2023-05-23T10:59:54.351203Z,37.387

Brief Hospital Course:
 mr. [**known lastname 1022**] is a 72 year old male with no significant history who presented with weight loss, leukocytosis and diffuse liver lesions and was found to have widely metastatic adenocarcinoma from unknown primary.  hospital course was complicated by cholangitis with subsequent biliary stent placement and profuse gi hemorrhage. . # gastrointestinal (gi) bleed: he developed a large volume gi bleed while on the floor.  he had both bright red blood per rectum and hematemesis.  he was intubated for airway protection given his hematemesis.  the cause for the bleed was not definitively identified after 2 endoscopies, however, large clot burden was found in the biliary stent placed for cholangitis. it was thought that he was bleeding from his biliary system [**3-6**] necrosis of his large tumor burden.  he was treated with iv proton-pump inhibitors and octreotide.  he also received several units of packed rbcs, however, he continued to pass blood per rectum and had increasing iv fluid and vasopressor requirements to maintain his blood pressure.  because of his worsening clinical status and subsequent decompensation, a goals of care discussion was had with the family and he was ultimately made dnr/dni with comfort measures only.  a cta was not pursued in this setting. . # metastatic adenocarcinoma: the patient was initially admitted to floor for work up of his weight loss and imaging showed diffuse liver lesions, with liver biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma.  primary unknown but possiblities were cholangiocarcinoma and gastric carcinoma.  cancer screening was not up to date.  the patient was being seen by palliative care inpatient.  after being transferred to the micu for gib (see above), the patient's clinical status continued to deteriorate, and after discussion with the family, he was ultimately made dnr/dni and then cmo. . # cholangitis/sepsis: during admission, he developed fevers and right upper quadrant pain.  his liver enzymes were found to be elevated so he underwent an mrcp.  this found extrinsic compression of the biliary tree by tumor burden and a plastic stent was placed to open the drainage.  he was also started on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole and later broadened to vanc/zosyn.  once he developed bleeding from the stent (as above) his leukocytosis worsened and it was thought likely that he had re-obstruction of the biliary tree either by clot or tumor progression.  during this time, his lactate also increased to 14 and his pressor requirment increased. . # tumor lysis syndrome (tls):  after an episode of hypotension he developed laboratory abnormalities which were consistent with tls.  we suspected that his hypotension had caused tumor necrosis given his extensive tumor burden.  he was treated with iv fluids with bicarbonate and allopurinol.  unfortunately, his tls labs continued to trend upwards and he developed renal failure from tls. . # acute renal failure: secondary to tls as above.  also likely that periods of hypotension led to acute tubular necrosis, accounting for his decreasing urine output, as well as increasing creatinine.",931,"[{""start"": 239, ""end"": 248, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 462, ""end"": 469, ""text"": ""abdomen"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 484, ""end"": 489, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 569, ""end"": 574, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1181, ""end"": 1187, ""text"": ""gastro"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1181, ""end"": 1197, ""text"": ""gastrointestinal"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 263, ""end"": 271, ""text"": ""appetite"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2383, ""end"": 2390, ""text"": ""gastric"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 658, ""end"": 663, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 971, ""end"": 976, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2261, ""end"": 2266, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2281, ""end"": 2286, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2793, ""end"": 2798, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 1126, ""end"": 1130, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 1510, ""end"": 1514, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 1593, ""end"": 1597, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2899, ""end"": 2903, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3212, ""end"": 3216, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 1098, ""end"": 1109, ""text"": ""cholangitis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 1535, ""end"": 1546, ""text"": ""cholangitis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2699, ""end"": 2710, ""text"": ""cholangitis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3719, ""end"": 3726, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3753, ""end"": 3760, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3898, ""end"": 3903, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1618, ""end"": 1626, ""text"": ""necrosis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3539, ""end"": 3547, ""text"": ""necrosis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3858, ""end"": 3866, ""text"": ""necrosis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 440, ""end"": 448, ""text"": ""swelling"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1618, ""end"": 1626, ""text"": ""necrosis"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 3539, ""end"": 3547, ""text"": ""necrosis"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 3858, ""end"": 3866, ""text"": ""necrosis"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 541, ""end"": 546, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 273, ""end"": 292, ""text"": ""shortness of breath"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1333, ""end"": 1341, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",Bile duct,None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Urosepsis"", ""Skin and soft tissue"", ""Respiratory""]}",4,892,2023-05-23T10:58:53.205648Z,2023-05-23T10:58:53.205677Z,71.617

 aphasia

History of Present Illness:
 ms. [**known lastname 28403**] is a 73 yo rhw with h/o dm, pvd s/p l bka, af not on coumadin, p/w aphasia. the patient was last seen well at 9am on morning of presentation. at about noon, pt's daughter spoke to her on the phone, and speech was normal with no complaints. at 4pm, daughter returned home from work. the patient had walked to the door and opened it, but could not speak. her words were slurred and incomprehensible, the daughter could not tell if they were real words or not. the daughter made the patient sit down and drink some water. she was able to swallow. she was moving her arms and legs. she had no facial droop. a little while later, the patient was still not speaking and didn't look right (lips hanging, drooling) and ems was called. at baseline, the patient lives with her daughter, and requires some assistance since the bka [**10/2195**], but is able to cook, dress, and ambulate independently with her prosthesis. she has never had a stroke or seizure. she has been well recently.

Brief Hospital Course:
 the patient is a 73 year old right-handed woman with a history of dm, pvd s/p l bka, and af not on warfarin presenting with aphasia with predominantly comprehensive deficits, r hemianopia, and a r neglect with l gaze preference, likely secondary to cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke. her initial head ct did not show an initial infarct despite the presumed extended time from symptom onset. the patient was very hypertensive, and she was also agitated and therefore given two does of 0.25 mg lorazepam. she was started on a heparin infusion empirically given the history of atrial fibrillation off anticoagulation (stopped for her bka) and that the suspected area of infarct was not large. the patient was admitted to the neuro icu for further management. the next morning, the patient was noted to be somnolent, requiring extreme noxious stimuli to awaken and subsequently promptly fall back asleep. her neurologic exam was significant for decreased spontaneous movement on the rue with depressed withdrawal on the rue compared to lue. repeat ct failed to show any infarct. the patient became very agitated and aggressive in mri and was so it was not completed. ltm was done for concern of seizure but only showed generalized encephalopathy. lumbar puncture was done and showed normal csf findings. the dense somnolence was thought to be due to the lorazepam given that the patient's daughter reported a similar reaction to sedating meds in the past. however, on [**2196-6-23**], while still on ltm, the patient was seen to suffer a large left hemisphere seizure that generalized. this seizure prompted a parasympathetic response and her heart rate decreased to the 30s and she became hypotensive. code blue was called and the patient received several rounds of atropine and epi as well as being sedated, intubated, and started on dopa and levo. the patient's brain waves on eeg were noted to go flat during this time and based on this the patient was started on hypothermic therapy for 24 hours. after the cooling was complete, an mri was done that showed patchy left mca/pca infarcts as well as cerebellar lesions. the patient was weaned quickly off the pressors and then the sedation. she remained unresponsive to stimuli and this was thought to be due to metabolic/toxic causes as the patient had developed [**last name (un) **] at this time, which could be causing the unresponsiveness by either uremia or decreased clearence of previous sedation. nephrology was consulted [**6-26**] and they suggested a furosemide trial, to which the patient responded, but hemodialysis was eventually pursued to improve clearance and address her significant volume overload. on [**6-29**], she had an additional hypotensive episode with fever and was found to have thickened respiratory secretions and was treated empirically for ventilator-associated pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin. she was subsequently found to have e.coli bacteremia and bacteriuria and some in her sputum, so her antibiotics were tailored according to her sensitivities to ciprofloxacin only. seizure management and minimization of sedating medications was optimized at this time, but her mental status remained unchanged and poor. recurrent discussions with the patient's family (with no assigned health care proxy), including her daughter, nephew, and brother (the patriarch of the family) repeatedly indicated a desire to keep the patient full code. a final discussion occurred on [**2196-7-7**] after the patient's clinical status had not changed for several days, and the family made the decision to make the patient comfort measures only. after only a few hours on a morphine infusion and after being extubated, the patient passed away. she was pronounced deceased at 1700 on [**2196-7-7**].",922,"[{""start"": 622, ""end"": 629, ""text"": ""swallow"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 3657, ""end"": 3669, ""text"": ""hemodialysis"",

Brief Hospital Course:
 79m initially transferred from osh for interventional pulmonary evaluation of worsening inspiratory stridor, which was later identified as tracheobronchomalacia.  other issues included renal failure and metabolic derangement, resolving mssa bacteremia.  his current issues include a pleural based lung mass, anemia with occult positive stool, infections, hepatitis and paroxismal afib. . a.  pleural based mass:  please see attached ct reports.  this pleural based mass on the right was stable on his various ct scans.  radiology was concerned about it being a multilobulated right pleural-based mass without significant enhancement, local invasion or associated thoracic lymphadenopathy. no primary neoplasm identified elsewhere within the torso. this may represent post- infectious sequelae, mesothelioma, nerve sheath tumor or metastatic disease from unknown primary. if clinically indicated, biopsy could be performed.  question as whether this is an old finding or a more recent one.  of note, his respiratory status is stable on room air at time of transfer. . b.  tracheobronchomalacia/copd:  on initial arrival, patient had severe stridor concerning for urgent requirement of intubation. however, continuous bronchodilator treatment overnight induced near complete resolution of the stridor, and urgent intubation was not required.  on hospital day two, however, pt was intubated for airway protection given continued poor mental status and underwent bronchoscopy at that time which revealed no airway stenosis or external compression without significant tracheobronchomalacia.  following stabilization, pt was extubated and again required continuous bronchodilator therapy (including racemic epinephrine) as well as corticosteroids as empiric therapy for restrictive airway disease, with ultimate resolution of stridor.  therefore, it was felt that pt most likely had bronchospasm as a result of his metabolic derangement and renal insufficiency/uremia.  he has been stable on room air for several days now with nebulizer treatments written prn. the steroids are being tapered by 10mg of prednisone per day as his respiratory status has been stable and there is a concern for multiple infections including sigmoid colitis.  he is currently on 40mg. . c.  infections:  his wbc had trended down to about 11 but has risen back up slowly to 18.  this can partly be attributed to the steroid treatment, but also is concerning for infection. 1.  ct scan showed sigmoid colitis (please see attached reports).  we do not think this is ischemic colitis as he was ruled out with a normal lactate and bicarb.  of note he was occult blood positive and complained of abdominal pain especially when defecating.  he is being treated empirically for c diff (antigen negative x2 thus far) and for gram negative coverage with levoquin started today [**2189-6-25**]. given his recent high doses of steroids and his colitis, would have a low threshold for examining for free air if his abdominal pain worsens. 2. mssa bacteremia: per report, 12/12 bottles at osh and started on nafcillin on [**2189-6-15**], though no positive surveillance cultures here.  remained hemodynamically stable, no septic physiology and afebrile.  both tte and tee (performed while intubated) were negative for endocarditis.  no evidence for septic emboli on complete ct chest/abdomen/pelvis.  pt had initially complained of back pain on admission to osh, however denied this when he arrived here, so no search for epidural or paraspinal abscesses was made.  therefore, the source remains unknown for this infection.  would continue the nafcillin for 4-6weeks. 3.concern about the right pleural based mass is- does it represent an infectious source or malignancy?  see discussion above. . d.  acute on chronic renal failure: creatinine 2.7, fena 1.2%, no eos on smear, and bland sediment.  from chronic renal insufficiency (cr 1.7), but was thought to have developed acute tubular necrosis, though the etiology was unclear. nevertheless, uremia was felt to be the primary etiology of patient's poor mental status as well as partial contributor to bronchospasm.  patient did require phos binders.  his renal function has returned to it's original state with a cr of 1.7. he was started in epoetin 4000 units sc qmwf. . e.  heptatitis: no known hx liver disease,

History of Present Illness:
 ms [**known lastname 108741**] is a 43 year old woman with history of transverse myelitis leading to paraplegia, depression, frequent pressure ulcers, presenting with chills and reporting she felt ""as if dying"". upon presentation, she denied any shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, but did report diarrhea with two loose bowel movements per day. patient reported that she had a fallout with her vna and has not had any professional wound care since early [**month (only) 205**].

Brief Hospital Course:
 43 year old woman with transverse myelitis and paraplegia c/b severe pressure ulcers and several prior wound infections who presented on [**8-11**] with sepsis successfully treated with early goal-directed therapy thought [**2-19**] decubiti and osteomyelitis also with e.coli and subsequent e.cloacae urinary tract infection stable on current regimen of vancomycin and meropenem.  abx for empiric treatment of osteomyelitis.  patient also now with sister as legal guardian as of [**2129-10-7**], which is set to expire in [**2129-12-19**]. . #. osteomyelitis - upon presentation, the patient had several decubiti that could be probed to the bone.  an infectious disease consult was called and followed the patient throughout her hospitalization.  she was initially treated with vancomycin, cipro, and flagyl.  as she continued to spike through this regimen, she was changed to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.  she continued to spike and there was some concern for drug fever although the offending drug was unclear. vancomycin was stopped and the patient was maintained on sole therapy with zosyn.  as she continued to spike fevers and was repeatedly cultured without isolation of probable offending bacteria, the patient was imaged to look for possible fluid collection.  all antibiotics were stopped for approximately 2 days after an area of possible fluid collection was located in the patient's right hip. she was thereafter sent to interventional readiology for aspiration of the fluid. unfortunately, her course in ir was complicated when the ir needle broke off in her hip and had to be retrieved with a small incision by surgery.  there was discussion as to the potential benefit of bone biopsy if the patient continued to spike but the patient was resistent to this idea due to her protracted and complicated course.  she was started on vancomycin, flagyl, and ceftazadime on [**9-7**] and defervesced with this regimen.  on [**9-25**], patient developed fevers and a uti.  patient was started on meropenem and vancomycin which, as per id, was sufficient for empiric treatment for osteomyelitis.  the patient will take antibiotics for 6 total weeks, until end of [**month (only) 359**], for empiric treatment at [**hospital1 **]. . #. sacral decubitus ulcer / heel ulcers: most likely source of infection. able to probe to bone. plastic surgery team consulted but did not feel like she was a surgical candidate given chronic infection and the size of the wound. they did not believe that she needed an mri to assess for osteomyelitis, given presumed diagnosis as they were able to probe to bone.  wound care nursing made recommendations regarding how to treat wounds and followed patient throughout her stay with drastic improvement in her decubiti during her stay.  patient has wound care recommendations in discharge summary to [**hospital1 **]. . #. uti: the patient was found to have a highly resistant e.coli uti on [**9-5**]. she defervesced with ceftazadime and, since this antibiotic was necessary for her osteomyelitis treatment, she was continued on this antibiotic for her uti as well as her osteo.  patient subsequently developed a uti with fevers with e.cloacae sensitive to meropenem growing within urine on urine culture.  patient was summarily begun on meropenem and, in addition, was started on vancomycin for possible bacteremia that was, most likely, a contaminant, but was also used for empiric treatment of her osteomyelitis.  patient now on meropenem and vancomycin empirically for osteomyelitis treatment

History of Present Illness:
 79m with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma s/p metal biliary stent placement [**11-8**], who presents with fever x 1 day following repeat ercp. pt is a very poor historian, so most of the history is obtained through chart review and ed providers. the patient stated that he had the ercp done, returned home, felt really fatigued and unable to walk ([**3-7**] leg pain and weakness). his wife called 911 and he was taken to [**hospital1 18**] ed. denied any chest pain, abd pain, nausea, vomiting. +fevers to 104 at home, + chills. no headaches. no loc, no h/o syncope. . patient had second, outpatient ercp by dr. [**last name (stitle) **] the day prior to admission due to increasing pruritis and a ct at [**hospital1 **] that suggesting tumor ingrowth into the stent. he was pretreated with ampicillin 2gm iv, and gentamicin 80mg iv. ercp demonstrated a malignant-appearing biliary stricture affecting the hilumand right and left ducts. there was debris visible with in the stent at early cholangiogram. occulsion cholangiograqm revealed extensive stricturing of both left and right intrahepatic ducts. although a small left intrahepatic radical opacified, it was not possible to advance the balloon catheter in this direction. for this reason, no stent could be introduced. balloon sweeps were performed from just above the stent and down through the stent, and a moderate amount of debris was removed. even after multiple sweeps, there was some filling defect left in the upperprotion of the stent, consistent with a degree of tumor ingrowth. sticture not amenable to ercp, and suggested ptca as next intervention if futher obstructive symptoms occur. he was not discharged on any anti-biotic ppx. . today pt presents with fever to 103.8, no [**last name (un) 103**] pain. no nausea/no vomiting. c/o fatigue, with reported fevers at home of 103.8--pt took tylenol. in ed, hemodynamically stable. clinically appears well. wcc is 20. pt was pancultured and started on levo and flagyl per ercp fellow who review pt in am for consideration of ir guided drainage if abscess present. ct in er was equivocal regards to this. pt was therefore admitted for iv rehydration, iv abx and possible ir procedure. apparently had an episode of unresponsiveness in the ed + incontinence. stat head ct ordered--negative. dr.

Brief Hospital Course:
 1) gram negative septicemia due to cholangitis: bacteremia may have been secondary to manipulation during ercp.  ruq ultrasound showed no evidence of cholecystitis.  culture grew enterobacter.  patient received ampicillin and gentamicin while in house and was discharged on po cipro.  surveillance blood cultures remain negative.  plan for total of 14 days of antibiotics.  patient is hemodynamically stable.  lfts are steadily improving. percutaneous biliary drain was discussed but was not necessary given bili trending down with the cleaning of the stent done on initial ercp. . 2) cholangiocarcinoma/locally metastatic, growing into the stent, obstructing bile ducts:  patient is currently under hospice care. . 3) syncope: pacer was interrogated.  episode of ? vt noted but did not temporally correlate with patient's episode.  more likely this was due to transient hypotension in the setting of his sepsis.  however, could certainly consider aicd once bacteremia completely treated given concurrent low ef (ef 20-30%).  however, patient is in hospice and likely would refuse.  this was not discussed during his inhospital course. neuro exam was normal and head ct was negative.  orthostatics were negative.  no significant arrhythmias on tele other than a transient tachycardia ep believes was possibly afib/flutter, ventricularly paced. . 4) renal cyst:  incidental finding on ct.  consider follow-up ultrasound to better characterize, as recommended, if patient agreeable. . 5) h/o cad: patient is on an aspirin and a beta blocker.  he denied any chest pain.  his statin was held due to bump in lfts.  could consider restarting at follow-up but likely little benefit given overall prognosis and patient will continue to be at risk of recurrent transaminitis. . 6) h/o colitis: patient was continued on his home asacol, anaspaz . 7) arf: resolved with ivf.  likely prerenal.  please resume diovan at follow-up visit if creatinine and blood pressure remain stable. . 8) coagulopathy: resolved with vitamin k.  inr 1.9 on admit, now 1.4. . 9) dispo: discharged home with prior hospice services . 10) code status: dnr/dni",905,"[{""start"": 2534, ""end"": 2543, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 3252, ""end"": 3261, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 518, ""end"": 523, ""text"": "" abd "", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 3430, ""end"": 3433, ""text"": ""ruq"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 2726, ""end"": 2731, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2957, ""end"": 2962, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 5093, ""end"": 5100, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 3977, ""end"": 3981, ""text"": ""bile"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 103, ""end"": 107, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 926, ""end"": 930, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3769, ""end"": 3773, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3825, ""end"": 3829, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3352, ""end"": 3363, ""text"": ""cholangitis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 5069, ""end"": 5082, ""text"": ""transaminitis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3472, ""end"": 3480, ""text"": ""cystitis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 5093, ""end"": 5100, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 4665, ""end"": 4672, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1926, ""end"": 1937, ""text"": ""hemodynamic"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3702, ""end"": 3713, ""text"": ""hemodynamic"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1252, ""end"": 1260, ""text"": ""catheter"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 1252, ""end"": 1256, ""text"": ""cath"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 4045, ""end"": 4050, ""text"": ""pacer"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 4546, ""end"": 4556, ""text"": ""arrhythmia"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 507, ""end"": 512, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 4872, ""end"": 4877, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 4843, ""end"": 4847, ""text"": ""beta"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 409, ""end"": 412, ""text"": ""leg"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3214, ""end"": 3217, ""text"": ""leg"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 735, ""end"": 743, ""text"": ""pruritis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 2115, ""end"": 2122, ""text"": ""abscess"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 2402, ""end"": 2407, ""text"": ""neuro"", ""labels"": [""Neurological""]}, {""start"": 4453, ""end"": 4458, ""text"": ""neuro"", ""labels"": [""Neurological""]}]",Bile duct,None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Gastrointestinal"", ""Urosepsis"", ""Endocarditis"", ""Skin and soft tissue""]}",4,866,2023-05-23T10:28:29.294723Z,2023-05-23T10:28:29.294756Z,33.738

 dyspnea and hypoxia

History of Present Illness:
 this 72m pediatrician was diagnosed with t-cell lymphoma 4 weeks

Brief Hospital Course:
 the patient is a 72-yo retired pediatrician with a recently diagnosed t-cell lymphoma s/p one cycle of chop (d+26), who presented with fever, rash, persistent dry cough, elevated lfts, acute renal failure, and worsening oxygen requirement, transferred out of the icu for continued care. he was also noted to have one episode of brbpr and multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on exertion, which were symptomatic with palpitations and dizziness, and resolved with rest. . #. fevers - the pt presented with fever, leukocytosis with left shift and bandemia, persistent non-productive cough, and worsening oxygen requirement, raising concern for a pneumonia. cxr on admission was unremarkable, and non-contrast chest ct was also non-specific. culture data has all shown ngtd, with urine legionella antigen negative, mycoplasma pneumonia dna not detected, and beta-glucan and galactomannan currently pending. he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, aztreonam, azithromycin, and flagyl. the infectious disease team was involved with his care. his hypoxia greatly improved since his admission, with resolution of his dyspnea and tachypnea, and weaned off oxygen to room air. he defervesced and remained afebrile >72hrs, so his antibiotic regimen was changed to meropenem and azithromycin. a repeat portable cxr was non-diagnostic, and the patient completed his full course azithromycin as an inpatient. he was discharged on daily ertapenem to be taken as an outpatient for 7 more days. . #. hypoxia - the pt presented with a significant oxygen requirement, dyspnea, and tachypnea. his cxr was unremarkable as above, and non-contrast chest ct was non-specific. he was treated as above for a probable pneumonia, although all micro data was negative. he significantly improved with this treatment, with resolution of his tachypnea, dyspnea, and hypoxia. his sob also improved with an ipratropium inhaler that had been started for mild wheezing. a repeat portable cxr was again non-diagnostic. his antibiotic regimen was completed as above. . #. h/o dvt - the patient had a history of dvt approx 4 weeks prior to this hospitalization, being treated with coumadin at home for anticoagulation. his inr was supratherapeutic to >7 on admission, and reportedly up to 9 at osh. he received vitamin k, and his inr trended down to below 2.0 prior to restarting his coumadin. he was discharged to home with a plan to restart his coumadin at 5mg daily for now, with daily inr checks and adjustments to be made to his coumadin dose. he would be bridged to a therapeutic level with lovenox as an outpatient. . #. atrial tachycardia - the patient had an episode of a-fib with rvr in the micu, in the setting of increased sympathetic tone with infection, fever, and dehydration. this was treated with iv lopressor, and the pt had a good response to this. the cardiology team was involved, and recommended continuing on a low-dose beta-blocker such as metoprolol 25mg. the patient was started on metoprolol 12.5 for ectopy noted on his telemetry, but he developed wheezing after this, so the medication was discontinued with relief of wheezing. he then had a tte that was unrevealing. he was noted to have more episodes of symptomatic a-fib with rvr while on the floor, so he was started on a low-dose ccb with good control and no further events on telemetry. this low-dose ccb was changed to a long-acting formulation prior to discharge. . #. brbpr - the patient described 1 episode of brbpr when trying to move his bowels. he noted that this was more bleeding than he has had in the past (h/o hemorrhoidal bleeding). he also has known sigmoid diverticula, seen on a screening colonoscopy here 5 years ago. his vital signs were stable, but his hematocrit slowly trended downward to 30 from 37.5 before stabilizing. his bleeding was felt to most likely be hemorrhoidal bleeding in the setting of his low platelets, but given the recent supratherapeutic inr, the gi team was consulted as other causes of bleeding such as diverticula were also being considered. the gi team also felt that this was likely hemorrhoidal bleeding and not a more serious source given his small amount of bleeding. the did however recommend further work-up of the gallbladder, including labwork and an mrcp. the patients hematocrits stabilized prior to discharge and he had no further evidence of bleeding. he was continued on protonix. . #. thrombocytopenia - the patient presented with thrombocytopenia and continued decrease in platelet count throughout the admission. he was not on any medications suspected to cause thrombocytopenia, although he had recently been on levofloxacin which may have contributed. hitt was also considered given the diagnosis of a dvt 1 month prior that likely would have been treated with heparin. heparin-dependent antibodies were negative for hitt, with anti-platelet antibody pending, but the patient's platelet count was recovering prior to discharge, up to 178 from a nadir of 50. . #. abdominal discomfort - the patient initially presented to osh with elevated lfts and ruq us findings of gallbladder wall thickening, which was confirmed on ruq us here. the ggt on admission was not helpful as it was indicative of both bony and hepatic sources of elevated alk phos. there was concern for lymphomatous involvement rather than infection. the patient's lfts continue to trend downward without intervention, and he had only very mild discomfort on deep palpation of ruq, without any associated symptoms. his flagyl was discontinued given the low likelihood of cholecystitis, and he was seen by gi and general surgery, who recommended further work-up including a hida scan / mrcp. his hida scan was negative for cholecystitis, with hepatitis serologies, cmv viral load, [**doctor first name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody, and total igg pending on discharge. mrcp was not done given his improvement and the negative hida scan. . #. rash - the patient initially presented with a diffuse erythematous blanching maculopapular rash. initial ddx included drug rash to levaquin, infectious, or lymphomatous involvement. evaluation by dermatology advised that the rash is most likely a drug reaction to levaquin, and it was recommended that he use topical clobetasol for treatment. the rash continued to improve in color and extent during the hospitalization, and was resolved prior to his discharge. . #. acute renal failure - the patient initially presented to osh with cr 2.2, up from baseline 1.1. urine lytes reportedly consistent with pre-renal picture, and renal u/s essentially normal. his creatinine improved to baseline with ivf hydration. . #. t-cell lymphoma - the patient was diagnosed with t-cell lymphoma approx 4 weeks prior to his admission, and is now s/p first cycle of chop (d+26). further chemotherapy is to be determined by the pt's primary oncologist, dr. [**last name (stitle) 3315**], at [**hospital1 4601**]. continue communication with him regarding likelihood of receiving next cycle of chop. .",904,"[{""start"": 5195, ""end"": 5204, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 5280, ""end"": 5283, ""text"": ""ruq"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 5351, ""end"": 5354, ""text"": ""ruq"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 5673, ""end"": 5676, ""text"": ""ruq"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 3712, ""end"": 3717, ""text"": ""bowel"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 3873, ""end"": 3878, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 4435, ""end"": 4439, ""text"": ""gall"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 5299, ""end"": 5303, ""text"": ""gall"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 4439, ""end"": 4446, ""text"": ""bladder"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 5303, ""end"": 5310, ""text"": ""bladder"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 4001, ""end"": 4005, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 4507, ""end"": 4511, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 5938, ""end"": 5947, ""text"": ""hepatitis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 4439, ""end"": 4446, ""text"": ""bladder"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 5303, ""end"": 5310, ""text"": ""bladder"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 5772, ""end"": 5780, ""text"": ""cystitis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 5923, ""end"": 5931, ""text"": ""cystitis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 348, ""end"": 355, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 6612, ""end"": 6619, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 6764, ""end"": 6771, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 970, ""end"": 975, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 6703, ""end"": 6708, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 610, ""end"": 621, ""text"": ""palpitation"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 517, ""end"": 523, ""text"": ""atrial"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2811, ""end"": 2817, ""text"": ""atrial"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3055, ""end"": 3061, ""text"": ""cardio"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 900, ""end"": 905, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1847, ""end"": 1852, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1048, ""end"": 1052, ""text"": ""beta"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3126, ""end"": 3130, ""text"": ""beta"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 6460, ""end"": 6464, ""text"": ""beta"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 6194, ""end"": 6201, ""text"": ""erythem"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 976, ""end"": 979, ""text"": ""leg"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 300, ""end"": 304, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 6140, ""end"": 6144, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 6231, ""end"": 6235, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 6263, ""end"": 6267, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 6365, ""end"": 6369, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 6487, ""end"": 6491, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 837, ""end"": 846, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1016, ""end"": 1025, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1913, ""end"": 1922, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 321, ""end"": 326, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 774, ""end"": 779, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1343, ""end"": 1352, ""text"": ""tachypnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1784, ""end"": 1793, ""text"": ""tachypnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2032, ""end"": 2041, ""text"": ""tachypnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 18, ""end"": 25, ""text"": ""dyspnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1331, ""end"": 1338, ""text"": ""dyspnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1771, ""end"": 1778, ""text"": ""dyspnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2043, ""end"": 2050, ""text"": ""dyspnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2068, ""end"": 2073, ""text"": "" sob "", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Bile duct"", ""Urosepsis"", ""Endocarditis"", ""Respiratory""]}",4,865,2023-05-23T10:27:53.663712Z,2023-05-23T10:27:53.663741Z,72.569

[**hospital **] hospital course, patient continued to spike fevers and require vasopressors despite adequate fluid rescuscitation. cardiogenic shock is also likely in the setting of an ef of 15-20%.  according to patient's sisters, he had not seen a doctor in many years, and his baseline cardiac status is unknown.  he was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  unknown etiology of cardiac failure however, patient undoubtedly had coronary artery disease with a hemaglobin a1c of 11. . #. respiratory status:  patient was initially intubated at [**hospital3 **] to ensure a safe transfer to [**hospital1 18**].  he was never in acute respiratory failure.  the team considered extubation however, it was felt that patient's overall picture was too tenuous, and his mental status was unknown.  he continued to be intubated throughout his hospital stay. . #. jaundice:  patient lfts and bilirubin continued to rise throughout admission.  a right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed, which showed sludge but no evidence of cholecystitis.  hepatology seriologies were negative.  lfts continued to rise in the setting of sepsis and resultant liver failure. . #. coagulopathy:  patient presented to [**hospital3 **] with an inr of 5 and platelets of 69.  throughout his stay in the [**name (ni) 153**], pt/ptt and inr continued to be elevated and platelets decreased.  unclear etiology of coagulopathy but again, most likely sepsis leading to synthetic failure and poor platelet function. . #. dry gangrene:  patient with unknown chronicity of his bilateral foot ulcers, though presents with necrotic lesions on left and right feet.  vascular surgery was consulted who recommended bilateral amputations.  however, patient's family stated that he would not have wanted to live without his feet. as such, amputation was deferred.  a cta of legs was performed, which showed patent vessels up until his ankles. . #.

 respiratory distress

History of Present Illness:
  61 year old male with severe cad, unrevascularizable, s/p cardiac arrest with anoxic brain injury [**5-/2171**], chornic bronchitis, osteomyelitis, trached and peged, living in extended care, admitted to the micu after presenting to the ed with respiratory distress. was reportedyl in usoh when had episode of hypoxia, fevers to 101 and tachycardia. was placed on nrb and sating 90-100% on transfer to ed. . in ed - was able to be weaned to trach mask with good saturations nad no respiratory distress. got 1gm vancomycin and tylenol. was per call-in reportedly was on zosyn for pseudomonas colonization. when on floor, bp noted to be 70s systolic, responded well to iv fluid bolus. . of note: recently admitted [**8-14**], discharge [**8-21**] for fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea. was discharged on a 5 week course of vancomycin for osteo that was newly diagnosed on mri imaging of the hip, located @ ischial tuberosity and coccyx.  - no biopsy or debrediment performed.

Brief Hospital Course:
 61 y/o man w/multiple medical problems including cad complicated by anoxic brain injury, with multiple infectious foci admitted with an episode of hypoxia, tachycardia, fevers and hypotesion likely secondary to urosepsis. hospital course by problem: . # hypotension/sepsis: the patient's bp was in the 70s systolic and he was admitted to icu from the ed. he was occasionally hypotensive to sbp in the 80s in the micu, but he responded quickly to fluids and antibiotics and he was soon called out to the floor. on the floor he was continued on antibiotics and was clinically improving, awaiting placement, but he had increased secretions requiring frequent suctioning so he was transferred back to the micu and then back to the floors once secretions were under better control. his blood pressures remained stable with sbps in the 90s-110s, the patient is currently afebrile and normotensive.  the combination of fevers, hypotension, and elevated wbc count support the diagnosis of sepsis.  possible sources included pulmonary source, [**month/day/year **], possible line infections(picc x 6 wks), urinary and abdominal source (cholecystitis as possibly suggested by elevated lft's). cxr was normal, [**month/day/year **] cultures from [**hospital1 **] showed pseudomonas and proteus species, but blood cultures have been negative.  no obvious areas of erythema were seen around the pick site or sacral decubitus ulcer.  ruq us showed no cholecystitis or biliary disease.  urine cultures grew klebsiella as a likely source.  the patient was started on zosyn for pseudomonas and klebsiella coverage and switched to meropenem due to thrombocytopenia. (see below). . # hypoxia/respiratory secretions: his initial hypoxia was thought to be due to transient mucus plugging. his hypoxia resolved in the micu with trach care and suctioning however when he was on the floors he was noted to have increasing secretions which appeared benign and related to the patient's inability to manage secretions, however the nursing staff could not meet his suctioning needs so he was transferred back to the micu for more frequent suctioning. in the icu, he had more yellow and thick secretions, so there was concern for possible pneumonia, especially given that he developed a low grade fever and tachycardia, however those have resolved. his chest x-rays have not revealed any clear new consolidation, so it is felt at this time he does not have a pna. patient is not hypoxic. with the addition of tobramycin nebs [**hospital1 **] and sublingual levsin, his secretions decreased. the patient also completed a 4 day course of prednisone (60 mg po x4 days) for possible copd/bronchitis component in the micu. his sputum culture grew pseudomonas (meropenem resistant), but the consensus is that the patient is likely colonized. he has been continued on tobramycin nebs [**hospital1 **] to assist with mucous secretions for pseudomonas colonization (this is often given to patients with cystic fibrosis) with the plan to continue tobramycin nebs for 2 weeks, started on [**2171-11-6**], to complete course on [**2171-11-20**]. he requires suctioning to assist in clearing secretions (at least q3hrs) and additionally receives atrovent, fluticasone, and xoponex in place of albuterol (due to tachycardia) to manage copd symptoms.  the patient may benefit from scopalamine patches in the future if his secretions worsen and this may be discussed with his family. . #uti: in the micu the patient was started on vanc/zosyn/flagyl for sepsis. however, urine cultures grew pseudomonas and klebsiella and [**date range **] cultures from [**hospital1 **] grew proteus and pseudomonas sensitive to imipenem, and he was colonized with pseudomonus in the lungs, so vanc/zosyn/flagyl were discontinued and he was started on meropenem (for pseudomonas both in the urine and possibly in the bone- osteomyelitis- as pseudomonas grew from the coccyx [**hospital1 **] as well). the patient is being treated for uti and osteomyelitis (klebsiella and pseudomonas), with meropenem for a 6wk course (day 1 = [**10-18**], the last day will be [**11-29**]). . # history of sacral decubitus ulcer complicated by osteomyelitis (mssa+ s/p 6 weeks vancomycin at [**hospital1 **]). as part of the sepsis work up the patient was found to have pseudomonas sensitive to imipenem in his sacral ulcer [**hospital1 **] so was started on meropenem as above. a sputum culture grew pseudomonas resistant to meropenem, so there was concern that the sacral [**hospital1 **] could have pseudomonas resistant to meropenem as well and a repeat sacral [**hospital1 **] culture was obtained on [**2171-11-9**] which did not grow pseudomonas but is growing vre. it is thought this is likely contamination from feces as the clinical exam does not support cellulitis. osteomyelitis by vre could be possible but since the patient has been afebrile with no leukocytosis for the past weeks, we chose not to treat and trend his fever curve and wbc.  one can consider adding linezolid to his antibiotics (14 days for cellulitis) or daptomycin (for longer course if suspect osteo) if the patient develops signs of active infection. during the hospital stay a [**date range **] nurse evaluated him and his [**date range **] was managed per the [**date range **] nurse recommendations. plastics was also consulted and recommended continuing the current care, and to maximize nutrition and blood glucose control to assist in healing. the patient completed a 14 day course of vit c and zinc for sacral decub care started on [**10-22**]. . # thrombocytopenia: the patient's platelets decreased over the first 2 days of his hospital stay with a nadir on [**10-18**].  zosyn was discontinued (changed to meropenem) on [**10-18**] and his platlets subsequently increased. hit antibody was negative, so heparin was restarted on [**10-19**].  patelets continued to increase. . # cad: per past reports his coronary artery disease is non-revascularizable, and he is allergic to betablockers. he was continued on asa 81 and a statin. . # chf, systolic: the patient was bolused with gental ivf when needed for hypotension in his initial few days of admission. also his ins and outs were monitored and he demonstrated equal fluid balance. he did not demonstrate signs of fluid overload. . # dm: nph was increased to 7 qam and 8 qpm, fsbg under better control, also with riss. . # acute on chronic renal failure: the patient's creatinine varied widely in the past. on presentation his cr was elevated, thought to be due to hypovolemia. his cr came back to baseline at 1.6-1.8 with fluid resuscitation. . # history of atrial fibrillation: the patient is not rate controlled or anticoagulated but he had a normal rhythm during his stay. he occasionally becomes tachycardic with persistent hrs in the 100s but this seems to have resolved with using xopinex instead of albuterol for nebulizers. he tends to get more tachycardic (120a) after suctioning and when he is uncomfortable. his tachycardia is felt less likely to be due to infection as he has been afebrile, and has a normal wbc count, and is on meropenem. he is still somewhat tachy with baseline hr in the 80s-100s . # altered ms - multifactorial in etiology and chronic. contributants include: anoxic brain injury, demylenating disease, known dementia, prior cva,and h/o thought disorder. he is able to follow some commands, and his mental status has improved during the course of his admission. . # agitation: patient had been scratching his upper extremities with multiple excoriations, likely due to agitation. he was given ativan 0.5 mg iv q4h:prn aggitation and was started on hydroxyzine 50 mg po q6h:prn anxiety. he has fewer excoriations, just on l arm now.  micu, continue. . # anemia- likely anemia of chronic disease, cont to trend . # fen: tube feeds via peg, recently de-clogged, tube feeds at goal. . # ppx: heparin sq, pneumoboots, sucralfate (as pt had thrombocytopenia and was taken off ppi), bowel regimen . # code: full . # dispo: to [**hospital 3058**] rehab. placement has been a problem for him due to insurance issues. . # communication: brother/hcp [**name (ni) 11312**]

 transfered from osh for medical management of ami and other multiple medical problems.

History of Present Illness:
 patient is a poor historian. the following history is taken from the notes and from the patient. . mr. [**known lastname **] is a 73 yo m who is transferred from an osh s/p fall at home. he was brought by ems to the osh. he was found awake and alert but on the ground complaining of weakness and fatigue. per patient, he just couldn't get up. no loc or hitting his head. no loss of bowel or bladder function. he was brought to the osh and was found to have an elevated wbc, cr 4.8, and slightly elevated troponin i on admission. subsequent troponins continued to rise with a max of 4.7 and he was started on a heparin gtt. he was also found to be fluid overloaded and with ascities. he received a paracentesis with removal of 5l and dialysis (per his home schedule on t, th, sa). during the course of his hospitalization, he developed what was thought to be a gout flare in his right knee. he has received most of his medical care at [**hospital1 18**] in the past and was transferred here for further medical management. . on ros he denies current sob, cp, n/v, f/c, diarrhea. he makes very little urine on his own. he describes pain in his right knee which has improved slightly from yesterday. he denies any current lightheadedness, ha, changes in vision, cough, palpitations, or abdominal pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
 70 yo m with multiple medical problems including rv dysplasia leading to right heart failure and chronic hepatic congestion, esrd requiring dialysis, dm2 and an ami. . #ami: patient was asymptomatic but was found to have largely elevated troponins at the osh.  he does have esrd which obviously affects the troponin clearence in the blood.  he was continued on a heparin gtt originially on admission.  this is was stopped secondary to bleeding.  unsure about appropriate medical regimen given his extensive history and rv dysplasia. has tried bb in past but had symptomatic hypotension from it. likely no statin given his liver function. not on an acei currently. has h/o gi bleed- so careful with anticoagulation. probably reason he is not on asa. while in the hospital an asa was started. . #h/o multiple arrhythmias: s/p multiple ablations. pacer in place. ep consult in am to evaluate pacer and found it to be functioning well. . #paf: continued his home amiodarone and was monitored on telemetry.  the issue of anticoagulation is discussed above. . #dm2: patient not on medications on transfer. will start with humalog sliding scale and add standing insulin based on 24 hour usage.  his fingersticks were monitored and found to always be within the 100-150 range qac.  he was placed on an insulin ss with humalog but did not require any use of insulin. . #esrd: requires dialysis t, th, sa.  the renal fellow was notified and made recommendations regarding his nephrocaps and phoslo and calcitriol.  he underwent dialysis as schedule. . #chronic hepatic congestion: requires paracentesis twice a week.  he was monitored closely and a therapeutic paracentesis was performed on [**2100-12-6**]. . #right-sided and left-sided heart failure: from rv dysplasia. he was placed on a 1l fluid restriction and a cxr on admission showed no evidence of fluid overload.  as above, he was monitored for ascites build up. . #erythematous right knee: considered gout flare at osh given this is a recurrent site for him. given wbc and diff with bands and metamyl, concern for cellulitis. patient received vancomycin at osh. continued allopurinol and stopped colchicine secondary renal insufficiency.  rheumatology was consulted and tapped his pre-patellar bursa three times to remove fluid.  it grew out staph aureas which was mssa.  vancomycin was changed to nafcillin.  ortho was consulted for concern over a septic joint.  despite pain in his knee, the patient was able to ambulate on the joint and it was believed the infection was not in the joint itself.  ortho did decided to take him to surgery for a wash out procedure.  during the procedure he developed hypotension which continued in the pacu.  he was transferred to the ccu. he never recovered from the procedure and expired in the ccu. his family wanted an autopsy performed. . #hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.  tfts were wnl. . #code status: full code",876,"[{""start"": 1418, ""end"": 1427, ""text"":

 73 year old female with residual lll pna admitted with unresponsiveness followed by pea arrest, hypotension, and respiratory failure intubation. . # pea arrest: clinical history suggests apnea likely causing hypoxia/hypercarbia and likely resultant pea arrest. . # respiratory failure: pt with likely underlying hypercarbic respiratory failure as per daughter's history.  ms [**last name (un) 70759**] was attempted to ventilate at low tidal volumes given her history of lung rescection.  she was treated for pneumonia broadly with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.  she eventually became further volume overloaded as her renal failure progressed and more difficult to ventilate. . # shock: etiology likely [**1-5**] sepsis from unknown source.  ms [**name13 (stitle) 70760**] was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, flagyl) to treat a presumed pulmonary source.  ms [**known lastname **] was maintined on vasopressors, initially with levophed. as her hospital course progressed she became progressively hypotensive despite ivf bolus.  she she was started and phenylephrine in addition but developed a severe lactic acidosis and abdominal distension which was hypothesized to be secondary to gut ischaemia and her pressors were changeed to dopamine and vasopressin with high requirements. . # acute renal failure: ms [**known lastname **] was admitted with an elevated cr of 2.6 above her baseline of cr 1.8, now 2.6. it was considered likely to be [**1-5**] atn + prerenal state.  her renal failure worsened during her admission despite agressive fluid recussitation and eventually became anuric and progressively acidotic with a lactic acidosis.  discussions with nephrologists and the families were held and it was decided that the family did not want to pursue dialysis given her very poor overall poor prognosis. . # skin: due to ms [**known lastname 70761**] severe skin changes, dermatology was consulted who felt that her condition was likely either acute generalized erythematous pustulosis or severe pustular psoriasis; they did not feel that it was superinfected.  she was treated with steroid creams but her condition worsened with desquamation of her skin which likely contributed to her electrolyte abnormalities and acidosis. . # due to ms [**known lastname 70762**] severe illness which worsened despite aggressive critical care, a meeting was held with the family and the decsiion was to make the patient dnr and to not escalate care (meaning not to initiate dialysis).  she was maintaned on vasopressors and antibiotics with ventilator support.  her condition worsened over 24 hours and she became progressively hypotensive, acidotic, and died of cardiac arrest.  the family was at her side and a priest was called.  the family declined a post-mortem examination.",867,"[{""start"": 2662, ""end"": 2671, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 1428, ""end"": 1435, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 1428, ""end"": 1435, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2123, ""end"": 2130, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2831, ""end"": 2838, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3018, ""end"": 3025, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2992, ""end"": 2995, ""text"": ""atn"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1284, ""end"": 1290, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 4198, ""end"": 4205, ""text"": ""cardiac"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 178, ""end"": 182, ""text"": ""cabg"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3509, ""end"": 3516, ""text"": ""erythem"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 543, ""end"": 547, ""text"": ""skin"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1369, ""end"": 1373, ""text"": ""skin"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3355, ""end"": 3359, ""text"": ""skin"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3405, ""end"": 3409, ""text"": ""skin"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3697, ""end"": 3701, ""text"": ""skin"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 548, ""end"": 552, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1384, ""end"": 1388, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 553, ""end"": 561, ""text"": ""pruritis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 18, ""end"": 29, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 209, ""end"": 220, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1604, ""end"": 1615, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1756, ""end"": 1767, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1815, ""end"": 1826, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2000, ""end"": 2009, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1624, ""end"": 1634, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2378, ""end"": 2387, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1528, ""end"": 1531, ""text"": ""pna"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 136, ""end"": 140, ""text"": ""lung"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1962, ""end"": 1966, ""text"": ""lung"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1182, ""end"": 1190, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1624, ""end"": 1634, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",Non-identifiable,None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Urosepsis"", ""Endocarditis"", ""Skin and soft tissue"", ""Respiratory""]}",4,827,2023-05-23T09:40:23.060310Z,2023-05-23T09:40:23.060339Z,32.654

Brief Hospital Course:
 67 year-old w with hypertension, diabetes mellitus ii, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, pulmonary embolism, porcine mitral valve replacement and coronary artery disease status-post cabg ([**2112**]) complicated by chronic sternal wound infection with multi-drug resistant pseudomonas and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase e coli who presented from rehab with fever and was found to have esbl klebsiella bacteremia, and mdr pseudomonas in her sternal wound. she was placed on iv colisitin. on [**8-20**] she went for surgical debridement of her chronic wound by plastic surgery. after which, she had a wound vac in place. . the patient's extended hospital course was complicated by an episode of tachycardia (appeared to be multifocal atrial tachycardia), hypotension, and altered mental status for which she was transferred to the icu. the inciting event is unclear. ct head was negative for acute change, ct chest angio was negative for pe. she had evidence of an nstemi, likely secondary to increased demand in the setting of tachycardia. an echocardiogram revealed no changes. daptomycin was added for increased antibiotic coverage, but then removed after the patient improved relatively quickly with little intervention except for hydration, then lasix, and metoprolol for heart rate control. she did have a drop in hematocrit for which she received 1u prbc with an appropriate response. stools were guaiac negative, hemolysis and dic labs were also negative. she was transferred back to the floor and remained stable for the rest of her admission. . # bacteremia: the patient's initial [**month/year (2) **] cultures (4/4 bottles) grew esbl klebsiella. her wound culture grew mdr pseudomonas. her urine culture was negative. given the resistance profile she was started on iv [**last name (lf) 111095**], [**first name3 (lf) **] infectious disease recommendations. plastic surgery was concerned for possible gallbladder pathology and requested a ruq ultrasound, which revealed a midly thick gallbladder with mobile gallstone and no other evidence of acute cholecystitis. a chest ct showed no change in her sternal wound, no evidence of fluid collection. given that the wound was the likely source of her bacteremia, she underwent debridement on [**8-20**] by plastic surgery with subsequent wound vac placement. she was continued on iv colisitin for two weeks following debridement (last day [**2114-9-4**]). she remained afebrile, and without a leukocytosis. her surveillance [**month/day/year **] cultures were all negative. plastic surgery performed regular wound vac changes. her wound appears to be healing well. her pain was controlled with 0.5 of iv morphine. she will need continued wound vac changes twice weekly. she will also need to follow up with dr. [**first name (stitle) **] of plastic surgery, and with the infectious disease specialists, as specified in his dischrage worksheet. . # anticoagulation: given her history of venous thromboembolisms while on coumadin, mitral valve replacement, and history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the patient was placed on an argatroban drip prior to and after her surgical procedure. this was discontinued in the micu. she was then re-started on coumadin after transfer to the floor. she was kept on pneumboots until her inr was consistently theraputic (goal [**12-27**]). on discharge she was on coumadin 2 mg daily, given at 4pm. she will need continued [**month/day (3) **] work to monitor her inr and re-dose the coumadin as appropriate to achieve inr goal of [**12-27**]. . # acute kidney injury: the patient has had a slowly increasing creatinine (1.1 on day of discharge, 0.5-0.6 baseline) secondary to poor po intake and low volume status. we have held her lasix (normal dose furosemide 20 mg po daily) and lisinopril (normal dose 5 mg po daily). she will need monitoring of her kidney function by repeat creatinine measurements, and likely future re-initiation of her anti-hypertensives once her volume status corrects and kidney injury resolves. also, the patient has needed frequent repletion of her potassium and magnesium during her hospitalization, likely due to poor nutritional status and being on diuretics. now that her furosemide has been held, we anticipate these repletions will be less frequent. she will need monitoring of her electrolytes, and supplementation as needed, upon arrival to the skilled nursing facility. . # anemia: the patient has a chronic, normocytic anemia that slowly trended downwards during her admission. her stools were guaiac negative, and she had no evidence of hemolysis or dic. she likely had appreciable [**date range **] loss from her surgical site, as the wound vac output was sanguinous. her hematocrit never fell below 21%, but given her cardiac history, and physiologic signs such as tachycardia, as well as endorsed dyspnea, she received one unit of packed red [**date range **] cells on two separate occasions, and responded appropriately. . # malnutrition: the patient was assessed by nutrition who recommended tube feeds. the patient was [**first name9 (namepattern2) 5439**] [**last name (un) **] hoff tube placement for supplementation on three separate occasions and refused. this should be addressed in the future. . # tachypnea: the patient's respiratory rate has been elevated since admission, and does not correlate with the sensation of dyspnea. this appears to be chronic in nature, perhaps secondary to her severe kyphosis and an element of anxiety. there was no evidence of pulmonary embolism seen on two different chest cta. her cxrs were negative for pneumonia or signs of fluid overload. her oxygen saturation remained within normal limits on room air. occasionally she complained of dyspnea, and wheezes were heard on pulmonary exam. she responded well to ipratropium nebulizers.",854,"[{""start"": 3038, ""end"": 3041, ""text"": ""ruq"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 2479, ""end"":

 49 f pmh pulmonary htn on flolan, sle, apa syndrome, underwent recent hickman change due to line infection who returned with likely line sepsis. . #) sepsis: most likely due to hickman line infection.  she was in the icu for sepsis for a few days where she received several liters of fluids, pressors which were quickly weaned, high dose antibiotics and stress dose steroids.  she was subsequently transferred to the floor when off pressors x 48 hours. ua/culture remained negative. cxr negative for infection. of note, her hickman was removed [**5-24**] and a rij placed.  she was treated with gentamycin/linezolid since [**5-24**] until [**5-26**] when daptomycin replaced linezolod (see ""headache"" section below) and then on [**5-27**] we switched gentamycin to levofloxacin to prevent gentamycin induced toxicity.  all of the antibiotic regimens were per id recs.  no blood or catheter tip cultures grew out any organisms during this admission.  on the floor she remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile with no further signs of sepsis.  she had a midline placed [**5-28**] for 8 more days of home antibiotics (per id) to end [**6-6**] and she had her hickman replaced by surgery without event on [**5-29**]. . #) pulmonary htn: she had a right heart cath on [**5-27**] which revealed pulmonary hypertension with mean pa pressure of 47mmhg with pa systolic of 70.  the pvr was 513. there was elevation of ra pressure with mean ra of 15mmhg. the pcwp was near normal at 13mmhg.  the cardiac index was preserved.  based on this, and concersations with dr. [**last name (stitle) **] (pulmonology) we will continue flolan at home for now via her hickman.  she has follow up scheduled with dr. [**last name (stitle) **] to discuss further management of her pulmonary htn. . #) tooth pain:  pt with right questionable tooth infection prior to admission.  she had considerable pain and headaches off amitriptyline.  based on this we got panorex films of her jaw and a dental consult.  per dental recs, there was no obvious source of infection/abscess and she was recommended for outpatient dental workup. . #) sle: stable throughout admission.  we continued steroid taper for a few days after stress dose steroids.  as she has had recurrent infections in the past few months, we consulted dr. [**last name (stitle) **] (rheum) re: tapering her home prednisone which may be contributing to her susceptibility to infections.  per dr. [**name (ni) 29165**] recs, we will discharge ms. [**known lastname **] on 9mg daily prednisone and she will follow in the outpatient setting and consider a further taper. . #) migraine ha: patient was off amytriptilline for migraine prophylaxis while on linezolid (due to increased risk of seratonin syndrome).  her headaches were significantly worse off her home meds.  we temporized with toradol, and dilaudid prn and eventually switched from linezolid to daptomycin per id so we could resume amytriptilline which we did a few days prior to discharge.  her headaches subsequently improved significantly. . #) apa syndrome/history of hit: stable. coumadin was held for procedures/line placements and she remained off heparin products without event.  we resumed coumadin on day of discharge which she is on for line patentcy.  she will follow inrs in the outpatient setting. . #) dm: stable. fs qid, ssi while in house.  we resumed oral agents prior to discharge. . #) osa: stable.  on home oxygen during admission with stable o2 sats. .",848,"[{""start"": 3753, ""end"": 3757, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2327, ""end"": 2338, ""text"": ""hemodynamic"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2232, ""end"": 2240, ""text"": ""catheter"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 128, ""end"": 135, ""text"": ""hickman"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 182, ""end"": 189, ""text"": ""hickman"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 446, ""end"": 453, ""text"": ""hickman"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 1421, ""end"": 1428, ""text"": ""hickman"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 1528, ""end"": 1535, ""text"": ""hickman"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 1875, ""end"": 1882, ""text"": ""hickman"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 2511, ""end"": 2518, ""text"": ""hickman"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 3001, ""end"": 3008, ""text"": ""hickman"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 159, ""end"": 165, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 189, ""end"": 195, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 245, ""end"": 251, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 453, ""end"": 459, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 513, ""end"": 519, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 1442, ""end"": 1448, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 1482, ""end"": 1488, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 1535, ""end"": 1541, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 4595, ""end"": 4601, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 2232, ""end"": 2236, ""text"": ""cath"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 2610, ""end"": 2614, ""text"": ""cath"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 509, ""end"": 513, ""text"": ""picc"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 2841, ""end"": 2848, ""text"": ""cardiac"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2604, ""end"": 2609, ""text"": ""heart"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1027, ""end"": 1031, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3395, ""end"": 3402, ""text"": ""abscess"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1360, ""end"": 1369, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2573, ""end"": 2582, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2644, ""end"": 2653, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3111, ""end"": 3120, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",Catheter-associated,None of the above,Respiratory,4,808,2023-05-23T09:26:55.334894Z,2023-05-23T09:26:55.334926Z,46.035

Brief Hospital Course:
 sepsis:  the patient initially presented with severe sepsis, with lymphocytosis, hypoptension fevers, lactate of 6.3 with an anion gap acidosis, respiratory distress, and acute renal failure.  the patient was given aggressive fluid resusitation (6l ns), vancomycin, ctx, and flagyl.  in the ed, he was started on a levophed drip, which stabilized his bp.  after 24 hours on antibiotics and fluids, his levophed drip was discontinued with good effect.  moreover, his lactate returned to [**location 213**] levels with resolution of his acidosis.  he became afebrile, and his wbc returned to [**location 213**].  blood and urine cultures grew out yeast, specifically [**female first name (un) **] albicans.  id was consulted.  he was started on voriconazole, which was switched to fluconazole on [**7-4**].  a cxr showed a question of pneumonia, so the patient was maintained on ceftriaxone.  vancomycin was d/c'd.  moreover, an abdominal ct showed wall thickening in the procto-sigmoid colon.  however, c. diff toxin was negative.  gi was consulted, and they thought the wall thickening was consistent with proctitis secondary to watershed ischemia from his hypotension.  we maintained him on flagyl, however, given a previous history of diarrhea and ? of c. diff.  a prostate exam was normal, and ophthalmology ruled out optic endophthalmitis.  an echo showed changes consistent with age, but no definitive vegetations or endocarditis.  his exam did not demonstrate stigmata of endocarditis.  on transfer to the floor, his signs of sepsis had vanished; while on the floor he remained afebrile, without leukocytosis, and clinically continued to improve.  he had no signs or symptoms of infection at discharge.   at discharge, the patient is on oral flucaonazole to complete a 14 day course after being on voriconazole, started on [**6-30**] for his [**female first name (un) 564**] fungemia.  he has completed a 10 day course of ceftriaxone, which was switched to po cefpodoxime on [**7-4**] (started [**6-29**], completed [**7-9**]) for his lul pneumonia.  he will complete a 14 day course of flagyl for  proctitis, to be finished on [**7-13**].  he will follow up with opthalmology in [**11-28**] weeks. he will follow up with his pcp [**last name (namepattern4) **] 1 week.",847,"[{""start"": 2814, ""end"": 2823, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 1294, ""end"": 1299, ""text"": "" abd "", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 3124, ""end"": 3132, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2872, ""end"": 2877, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 271, ""end"": 278, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2226, ""end"": 2230, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 271, ""end"": 278, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 644, ""end"": 651, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2063, ""end"": 2070, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 195, ""end"": 200, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2508, ""end"": 2513, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1797, ""end"": 1803, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 1793, ""end"": 1797, ""text"": ""picc"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 1285, ""end"": 1290, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3309, ""end"": 3321, ""text"": ""endocarditis"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3365, ""end"": 3377, ""text"": ""endocarditis"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 156, ""end"": 159, ""text"": ""leg"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 160, ""end"": 165, ""text"": ""ulcer"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 2032, ""end"": 2043, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1340, ""end"": 1349, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1550, ""end"": 1559, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2720, ""end"": 2729, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3932, ""end"": 3941, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1571, ""end"": 1581, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1697, ""end"": 1700, ""text"": ""pna"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 713, ""end"": 723, ""text"": ""tachypneic"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 781, ""end"": 789, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1571, ""end"": 1581, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1539, ""end"": 1549, ""text"": ""aspiration"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",Respiratory,None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Urosepsis"", ""Skin and soft tissue""]}",4,807,2023-05-23T09:26:07.786716Z,2023-05-23T09:26:07.786745Z,43.781

Brief Hospital Course:
 pt is an 81 year old with pmh of t2dm, cad, and new history of painless jaundice with pancreatic mass on imaging, and elevated lfts suspicious for pancreatic tumor, in addition to hypotension with concerns for sepsis, requiring micu transfer.this is an 81 y/o male with dm, afib, ischemic cardiomyopathy with ef 35%, s/p pacer, with reported recent history of pancreatic mass on ct abdomen s/p ercp and eus with palliative biliary stent placement at [**location 1268**] va, initially transferred from [**hospital3 **] to micu green for hypotension (sbps 70s-80s). . he initially presented to wxva about 2-3 weeks ago with painless jaundice. his t. bili was reported to be in the low 20s and ap ~2200 his work up including a ct pancreas protocol which showed a large pancreatic mass at the head involving that involving the sma, smv and possible portal vein. patient underwent eus with biopsies which did not show carcinoma. however, brush biopsy (sent out) was highly suspicious for malignancy. his lfts improved after stent placement. after being home for 2-3 days (?left ama vs. discharged), he was brought to [**hospital3 **] by his wife due to continued jaundice and was transferred to [**hospital1 18**] for hypotension. . he was admitted to the micu for biliary sepsis and started on leveophed. he was continued on levophed for persistent hypotension, with continued poor response to ivf and low urine output. due to a question of an element of cardiogenic shock, tte was done, showing an ef of 35% and critical as. also, due to ue and le edema, ultrasounds were done which demonstrated left brachial and right peroneal dvts, so he was started on lovenox. a ptc was performed on [**8-29**] and the drained bile grew out pseudomonas and mrsa/ vanc/zosyn initially started but switched to vanc/cefepime/flagyl due to more favorable mics. with mixed picture of sepsis and cardiogenic shock, diureses with lasix 10mg iv was started with mild improvement of sbps to 90s-100s and improved uop. the pathology slides from the eus biopsies were obtained and there is no  confirmation of malignancy, but ca-19-9 is very elevated. ercp service was consulted for ercp vs. eus and asked for transfer to the [**hospital unit name 153**] for consideration of ercp in the am for replacement of the stent, which they believe may be occluded. he was transferred to the [**hospital unit name 153**] on [**9-2**]. . in the [**hospital unit name 153**], he was continued on leveophed, which was weaned off at 3 am [**9-6**]; and was continued on vanc/cefepime/flagyl.  ercp felt stent was still viable per [**last name (un) **] data, continued to have drainage from ptc.  went for eus on [**9-11**] that showed 2cm pancreatic head mass, but not biopsied given recent plavix use. [**doctor first name **] onc spoke with pt and family re: mass, however the family was not interested in surgical treatment nor would he likely be a surgical candidate given critical as and other medical comorbidities.  med onc saw patient on floor and felt that cancer was likely, but not definitive diagnosis without actual tissue.  pt initially refused medical oncologic treatment, as he was not interested in chemo and xrt.  abx d/c;d on [**9-12**] after 14d course.  plavix d'c'd on [**9-13**] given goc and risk of bleeding while on lovenox, aspirin and with likely malignancy. dr.

[**name10 (nameis) **] had been on asa 81mg daily, plavix 75mg daily. bb and acei initially avoided due to hypotension/low bp and statin held given elevated lfts. pt requested to continue his aspirin therapy. therefore, will continue this, but not plavix given that pt is on lovenox for dvt and triple therapy will increase bleeding risk especially with suspected malignancy.  restarted low dose bb, metoprolol 6.25mg [**hospital1 **] if bp allows to prevent discomfort from possible angina, tachycardias. . #acute renal failure-cr 0.7 to 1.2. likely prerenal from poor po intake and possible chf.  pt not given iv fluids as has chf/critical as and would likely cause flash pulmonary edema/hypoxia. . #dm2- continued hiss with finger sticks. conservative insulin coverage in order to avert symptomatic hyperglycemia. this can be discontinued, if becomes painful for patient. . fen: regular diet as tolerated . access: picc dc'd prior to discharge. . #goals of care-please note. pt had been cmo/dnr/dni per prior discussions in icu and goals of care conversations. however, pt decided day of discharge that he would not sign the dnr/dni comfort care form for the ambulance ride to [**hospital **] hospital.  he stated that he does not make decisions during emergencies and would want his wife called during an emergency to determine goals of care. explained that this is not feasible during an emergency and that a quick decision would have to be made. pt stated that we have to ""talk to his wife"" and that he would not sign the form at this time. .",846,"[{""start"":

 on arrival to icu on [**8-16**], pt was in septic shock with hypotension, increasing o2 requirement and decreasing urine output.  pt had a cvl and aline placed, cultures were sent, she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and aggressively resuscitated with fluids without significant improvement in bp. she remained febrile and tachycardic to 150s with a multi focal atrial tachycardia/aflutter.  she was pressor dependant on levo/neo to maintain a map of 65.  alternative pressor regimens were attempted to limit tachycardia and still maintain maps though it was very difficult to control the fast heart rates even after an amiodarone load.  over the following days, she became oliguric and her urine sediment showed muddy casts consistent with atn.  liver function tests were rising showing evidence of shock liver and she was unable to weaned from pressors (levo and vasopressin).  family meetings took place each day to discuss progression of illness and poor prognosis. both blood and sputum cultures returned positive for a multi-drug resistent pseudomonas and an proteus species was found in the urine culture.  infectious disease was consulted and antibiotics were broadened to include amikacin & colistin for double coverage of pseudomonas.  pt had baseline severe copd and pulm hypertension, these further complicated oxygenation and ventilation.  after she received initial fluid resuscitation, she developped bilateral consolidations likely due to effusions though also complicated by underlying pseudomonas pna.  she was requiring significant support from the vent (100% fio2 and peeps> 14) to maintain adequate oxygen saturations and had persistent metabolic acidosis due to lactates in the 5-6 range.  pt was receiving very little sedation and was noted to have minimal response to stimulation.   pt was initiated on cvvh in an attempt to improve acidosis and remove fluid in order to improve oxygenation.  she had some transiently decreased peep requirement though she was unable to weaned successfully from 100% oxygen.  after two days of cvvh,  she had persistent lactic acidosis, ongoing septic shock without any ability to wean from pressors or full vent support and the family decided to change code status to dnr.  that evening, she became progressively acidotic, hypotensive and difficult to oxygenate.  the family was brought in to the bedside and decision was made to provide comfort measures.    pt expired on the evening of [**2165-8-16**] from multiorgan failure and septic shock, family declined autopsy.",841,"[{""start"": 2931, ""end"": 2936, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2990, ""end"": 2995, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 4312, ""end"": 4316, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2925, ""end"": 2928, ""text"": ""atn"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1573, ""end"": 1578, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2289, ""end"": 2294, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2875, ""end"": 2880, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3282, ""end"": 3287, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2096, ""end"": 2102, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 2778, ""end"": 2783, ""text"": ""heart"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2546, ""end"": 2552, ""text"": ""atrial"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 18, ""end"": 29, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 235, ""end"": 246, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 379, ""end"": 390, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 422, ""end"": 433, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 497, ""end"": 508, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 590, ""end"": 601, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1142, ""end"": 1153, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 457, ""end"": 467, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 538, ""end"": 548, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3699, ""end"": 3702, ""text"": ""pna"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 174, ""end"": 178, ""text"": ""copd"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3453, ""end"": 3457, ""text"": ""copd"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1335, ""end"": 1343, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 457, ""end"": 467, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 538, ""end"": 548, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,Urosepsis,"{""choices"": [""Bile duct"", ""Endocarditis"", ""Respiratory""]}",4,801,2023-05-23T09:22:14.584561Z,2023-05-23T09:22:14.584593Z,53.41

History of Present Illness:
 this 43-year-old male patient with a history of esld, cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis c, genotype i, he had been followed in the [**hospital 1326**] clinic (last visit [**2185-9-21**]). presented with mildly encephalopathic status and has significantly worsened synthetic function of his liver with low albumin, high inr, and low glucose, meld 38. acute on chronic renal failure with uremia in setting of gnr bacteremia. pt has significant h/o unilateral rle lymphedema, with progressively worsening pain and tenderness and uncompromised perfusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
 patient was admitted with worsening liver disease, acute on chronic renal failure, with encephalopathy/ uremia in the setting of gnr bacteremia/sepsis and worsening swelling/ cellulitis of the rle. he was admitted to the sicu on [**2186-1-25**]. comparment syndrome was ruled-out, but he was noted to have increasing erythema, pain and tenderness over the right lower extremity up into the thigh.  he became hypotensive requiring volume resuscitation and intermittent vasopressors. broad-spectrum antibiotics were started. plans were made to explore the right lower extremity for concern for a deep infection and underwent an extensive debridement of the rle on [**2186-1-26**]. the patient tolerated the procedure well. he intermittently required neo-synephrine for hypotension in the or. he was transferred back to the icu. on [**2186-1-27**], he was taken to the or again for re-exploration of the rle and to assess the need for further debridement. a washout and further debridement, specially of the anterior incision of the lower leg was made. he was taken intubated on low-dose neo- synephrine to the sicu in guarded condition. he was kept intubated, on neo and on cvvhd for his renal failure 2ry to atn. he was initially treated with vanc, cefe, clinda, flagyl for his gnr on osh. these actually grew pasturella, and additionally, his tissue cx grew staph coagulase negative (thought to be likely contaminant). he was continued on vanco, and started on high dose cipro, meropenem and clinda, following id recs. from a nutritional standpoint he was started on tube feeds on [**1-27**] via dobhoff catheter. the surgical wounds were managed initially with wet to dry dressing changes but ultimately with vac dressings applied at the bedside and changed every 3 days. the t.bili progressively increased from 5.7 preop to 24.6 on [**2-2**]. his transaminases then started to worsen dramatically to [**telephone/fax (1) 78539**] (alt/ast) on [**2-5**] and up to 3640/[**numeric identifier 78540**] on [**2-6**]. his renal function also started to get worse on [**2-5**] with serum creatinine higher than 2.0 and up to 3.4 on [**2-6**]. he was evidently coagulopathic due to his liver failure and his inr was notably high during his stay in the icu, but significantly raisen from 2.1 to 3.6 on [**2-4**] and 7.6 on [**2-5**]. his platelets were also notably low, between 20,000-40,000 and getting down to 12,000 on [**2-2**]. on [**2-3**] his clinical status changed, started again with hypotension requiring pressors, not following commands. additionally, hit antibody was found to be positive, thus heparin products were d/c'd and argatroban gtt was started on [**2-4**]. on [**2-5**] patient was complicated with melena -

Brief Hospital Course:
 mr. [**known lastname 31292**] is a 43 yo man w/ hiv cd4 150, vl 200k, admitted with respiratory failure secondary to pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). . # hypoxia/resp distress:  thought to be due to pcp, [**name10 (nameis) **] recent history and positive testing for pcp in sputum. was treated with primaquine, clindamycin, and prednisone with initial improvement, but then had questionable medicine non-compliance in recent days and clinical deterioration. of note, he was ruled out for tb on last admission and had negative infectious work up otherwise. on admission, id service counted pills and patient had too many in bottle to have taken anti-pcp meds daily, so unclear if this episode represents treatment failure or incomplete treatment for pcp. [**name10 (nameis) 227**] patient's distress, patient was semi-urgently intubated. patient was started on iv bactrim and solumedrol (allergy to bactrim very questionable). given low cd4 count, patient was also covered for other bacterial pna. bronchoscopy was performed with bal which was sent for gram stain, pcp, [**name10 (nameis) 18617**] pathogens and came back positive for pcp. [**name10 (nameis) **] histoplasma, legionella was also sent and were negative. cmv [**name10 (nameis) 18617**] load was checked as well as coccidomycoses serology which were negative. empiric cap coverage was started with azithromycin and ceftriaxone. patient then developed a rash, maculopapular, initially over his anterior chest which then spread to his face and legs. bactrim was discontinued since patient had had a questionable allergy to bactrim in the past. id was consulted regarding optimun treatement of pcp. [**name10 (nameis) **] was made to restart bactrim since this is the preferred treatment given his severe infection. patient was prophylactically treated one time with benadryl and did not subsequently develop the same rash. patient was also switched to vancomycin and ceftazidime for bacterial pneumonia coverage after id consultation. patient as continued on bactrim and steroids for pcp [**name initial (pre) 11091**]. serial cxrs remained unchanged showing bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates with sparing of the costophrenic/costodiaphragmatic angles. the patient's respiratory status improved with good ventilation/oxygenation by abg. patient was weaned off sedation and extubation was attempted on [**2103-8-16**]. patient did well in terms of his respiratory status, saturating well with abg 7.42/31/83. after approximately one hour, the patient began to decompensate rather acutely, became somnolent, unresponsive, with flaccid paralysis and therefore he was re-intubated for protection of his airway given the acute change in his mental status. after re-intubation, patient spiked a temperature of 101.7. patient was pancultured, sputum showed 1+ gram positive cocci and current antibiotics were continued with id following the patient closely. since this time, his respiratory status has remained stable with ongoing intubation pending workup of his mental status changes.  patient was successfully extubated on [**2103-8-20**] and saturating well with abg 7.44/37/118 post-extubation. patient was eventually weaned off o2 and sating 98% on room air.  patient continued on iv bactrim (to complete 21 day coarse) and tapered off steroids (methylprednisolone 20mg iv 11 day coarse).  cmv grew from bal culture and a repeat cmv [**date range 18617**] load was 13,400. for concern of cmv pneumonitis given the viremia and positive bronchial fluid culture, iv gancyclovir was started for a 1 week course (until [**8-31**]).  patient should then start po valgancyclovir 450mg po qod and this dose should be renally adjusted until cd4 count increases.  patient should have cmv [**month/day (4) 18617**] load checked on [**9-3**] to assess efficacy of treatment for cmv viremia.  if [**month/year (2) 18617**] load >600 copies would discontinue valgancyclovir and restart iv gancyclovir and treat for another 2 weeks at which time a cmv [**month/year (2) 18617**] load should be rechecked.  if [**month/year (2) 18617**] load <600, then switch from iv gancyclovir to po valgancyclovir and continue as directed above. patient completed methylprednisolone 11 day taper on day of discharge.  patient will also need to be on azithromycin 1200mg qwk as prophylaxis for [**doctor first name **] and bacrtim ss po qd after completion of iv bactrim for pcp [**name initial (pre) 1102**]. . # change in mental status: patient acutely decompensated after extubation, non-responsive, with flaccid muscle tone, reflexes present in both upper and lower extremities, toes were equivocal, no focal deficits but appeared to be in semi-comatose state. patient may have seized or post ictal since seen to be posturing at times, tremor present intermittently. ct head was negative for acute bleed or mass, although it was performed w/out contrast. lp performed subsequently which was clear, opening pressure 19, no wbc, protein/glucose wnl, crypto negative. toxo negative as well. neuro consulted, considering diagnosis of [**male first name (un) 2326**] virus as cause of pml. eeg showed diffuse encephalopathy but no focal seizure activity. mri showed occipital periventricular t2 flash suggestive of watershed stroke vs. hiv encephalopathy vs. pml. neuro continues to follow. csf cultures pending for hsv, rpr, [**male first name (un) 2326**] virus. now avoiding sedating meds to further eval changes in mental status. patient seems more [**male first name (un) 3584**] and more responsive but still very groggy and difficult to arouse.  patient's mental status gradually improved to be [**male first name (un) 3584**] and oriented x3, back to baseline. . # dropping hct: patient's hct baseline at approximately 25. gradually dropped down to a low of 20, requiring transfusion. later stabilized to 26-27 and not requiring transfusion for several days. likely low at baseline secondary to renal failure, also question of bone marrow suppression from bactrim, underlying hiv. iron studies not helpful in setting of transfusions. patient likely needs epo as outpatient given chronic renal failure. . # hiv: last cd4 150, [**male first name (un) 18617**] load 200k, not on haart currently given history of resistance to anti retrovirals and in setting of acute infection. likely to benefit from haart once over acute illness as outpatient, also in setting of possible cns infection. patient monitored and treated for any associated hiv infections. patient noted to have a few episodes of diarrhea on [**8-16**] likely [**12-27**] to aggressive bowel regimen, c. diff negative. patient followed closely by infectious disease.  haart was held initially and now resumed [**8-28**] on abacavir, lamuvidine, fosamprenavir, ritonavir. . # renal failure: patient with fsgs/hiv nephropathy and baseline cr around 6. renal consult placed a few days after admission and did not recommend dialysis as patient has been making good [**month/day (4) **], nor further worsening of cr. in addition, bactrim may falsely elevate cr. patient treated with ivf, limited diuretics, increased phoslo due to elevated phos, other electrolytes followed closely. patient also with low bicarb down to 15, possibly due to rta, improved with bicarb drip to 22, not requiring further treatment. hyponatremia [**8-28**] with no improvement after 1l ns.  not fluid depleted given no [**month/day (4) **] lytes and euvolemic on exam.  likely siadh given uosm>100, will fluid restrict and monitor na.  improved after fluid restriction of 1500 cc. . #

  59-year-old male with hemoptysis.

History of Present Illness:
  mr. [**known lastname **] is a 59-year-old male with history of renal cell carcinoma, lung metastases who has lesions, last one being on [**2119-9-11**].  he came in today for a follow-up bronchoscopy.  patient was supposed to have a bronchoscopy and was noted to have coughed up one cup of blood.  bronchoscopy at the time showed moderate bleeding in the right lower lobe distally, no bleeding from the endobrachial lesions.  the patient was recently admitted to [**hospital1 69**] from [**8-28**] to the had right lower lobe bleeding mass cauterized at that time. the patient has had multiple episodes of this hemoptysis at home.

Brief Hospital Course:
  the patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit.  the patient was going to have interventional radiology for right brachial arterial embolism.  the patient had a chest x-ray done and patient as monitored in the medical icu.  on [**2119-9-17**] the patient had an episode of hemoptysis about 30 ml.  the patient's hematocrit at that time went down to 24.8.  the patient was going to get transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells and x-ray radiation therapy was going to be conducted.  on that day patient had a repeat bronchoscopy which revealed fresh blood clots and clotting of the right bronchus.  the patient had that suctioned and cleared out.  the patient had desaturations as well down to the 40's with increased respiratory rate and increased blood pressure, positive hemoptysis.  the patient was emergently reintubated with a single lumen airway placed.  surgery consultation with thoracic surgery was obtained and they reviewed the chest x-ray and cat scan and thought the mediastinal and hilar parenchymal lesions were located such that pneumonectomy would not be possible.  plan was again to speak with radiation oncology and interventional radiology to see if they would further embolize more of the bronchial artery. on [**9-18**] the patient spiked a temperature of 102.2.  the patient remained intubated.  blood cultures were taken times two as well as urinalysis, urine culture.  the patient had right internal jugular line.  it was decided that this line will remain in due to patient's poor peripheral access and therefore was changed over wire with the tip sent for culture as well.  on [**2119-9-19**] blood cultures grew gram positive cocci which turned out to be staph aureus.  the patient was started on vancomycin 1 gm q 12 hours as well as ceftaz.  the patient remained afebrile that day but however, the line remained in.  further xrt was planned for patient to have palliative measures to the bleeding source and the right lower lobe.  the patient was suctioned as needed prn for increased bleeding as well.  on [**9-20**] the patient remained afebrile with a t max of 101.8.  the right ij culture grew out gram positive strep and positive cocci.  the patient was continued on his antibiotics, remained hemodynamically stable.  on [**2119-9-21**] the patient was extubated and patient was made dni status post extubation with no further intubations necessary.  the patient's cardiovascular exam revealed an irregular irregular rhythm with a rapid ventricular rate. the patient was given some lopressor 5 mg iv and diltiazem 20 mg iv push and then diltiazem 30 mg po q d for controlling of his rate.  the patient remained in atrial fibrillation and transferred to the floor on [**2119-9-21**].  on transfer to the floor the patient was stable, vital signs were stable at 98.5, 100, 104/64, 24, 96% on 40% cn.  heent:  pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, anicteric sclera.  neck, no bruits, no jugulovenous distension.  lungs, diffuse wheezing, rhonchus, decreased breath sounds on the right.  heart was irregularly irregular, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  abdomen soft, nontender, non distended.  extremities were warm with no edema.  neuro is alert and oriented times three.  the patient was continued on his vancomycin 1 gm q 12 hours.  the patient had no episodes of hemoptysis on [**2119-9-21**] while on the floor and remained afebrile.  the patient, on [**2119-9-22**], remained afebrile, no further episodes of hemoptysis.  the patient remained in house for further xrt treatment, for further palliation of his bleeding source.  the patient had no episodes of hemoptysis as i said for the last two nights.  the patient was continued on his diltiazem 30 mg qid, robitussin dm, tylenol 650 mg prn and vancomycin 1 gm q 12 hours.  the patient remained in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response in the 110's and 130's, had some runs of nsvt as well as vt which were both asymptomatic.  the patient was continued on diltiazem 30 mg qid.  in terms of id the patient remained afebrile and will continue the vancomycin.  in terms of his gi, patient remained stable prophylactically and patient was given pneumoboots and protonix 40 mg q d. patient's hematocrit remained stable on the floor with no further need for transfusion.  patient's vital signs were stable throughout the course of stay here. he  will be transferred home for hospice care and further palliative care.",824,"[{""start"": 3885, ""end"": 3892, ""text"": ""abdomen"", ""labels"":

 42f with h/o past utis but no admissions, s/p appendectomy, who presented to [**hospital1 18**] on [**2-7**] with complaint of llq pain x 5 days. pt states that she was in her usoh until pain began gradually in her llq, radiating to her l lower back. she took tylenol with motrin with little improvement. she denied any nause/vomitting or change in bowel movements at the time, and was stooling and taking pos. she also denied any overt dysuria or frequency. however, her pain subsequently worsened and she developed fevers, necessitating an ed visit. . in the ed, vital signs were t 105, p 120, bp 122/76. r 19 o2 99 on room air. ua was positive for nitrites, wbc, and bacteria and she was presumptively diagnosed with uti and pyelonephritis in the setting of her back pain. she was given 2l ns, po ciprofloxacin. urine hcg was negative and a pelvic examination was unremarkable. . however, on the floor her bp dropped to 80-90 systolic. vanco was added empirically. however, her bp remained low despite 2 500ml ns boluses and 1l ns bolus. she was therefore transferred to the micu. . in the micu she received aggressive ivf (3l). her bp remained in the 90s and her fever curve decreased. no pressors were needed. a blood culture gram stain on [**2-7**] grew gnr and antibiotics were changed to zosyn. despite this, she continued to have luq pain radiating to her back. she thus underwent ct abd/pelvis with findings c/w pyelonephritis. she also had subjective sob with cxr suggesting fluid overload. . on arrival to the floor, pt feels ""much better."" she states that her abdominal pain is largely resolved. she currently denies any ha, dizziness/lightheadedness, thirst, cp, sob, abd pain, nausea, lower ext pain, swelling

Brief Hospital Course:
 ms. [**known lastname 26234**] had an uneventful hospital course after transfer from the micu. . uti: positive u/a on admission with fevers and llq/left back pain consistent with pyelonephritis. ct abd pelvis with suggestive findings as well. no findings to suggest nephrolithiasis, obstruction, or abscess, renal function stable. she remained afebrile while on the floor and she was transitioned from zosyn to ciprofloxacin as sensitivities to positive cultures became available. . hypotension: resolved. unclear of baseline bp, though had [**location (un) 1131**] of 98/60 in [**2171**] and bp likely on the lower side at baseline. per patient, usual bp around 100/60. however, had hypotension to 80s sytolic in setting of pyelonephritis consistent with vasodilatory state/sirs/septic shock. after transfer to the floor, she maintained excellent urine output and her hypotension resolved. . abdominal pain: abdominal pain most likely related to pyelonephritis. lfts wnl, amylase and lipase wnl. ct abd with non-sepcific findings which are likely related to pyelonephritis. she did not complain of abdominal pain after transfer to the floor and required no pain medication. . pulmonary edema: patient developed subjective sob in setting of aggressive ivf. cxr with pulmonary edema and bibasilar crackles on exam. her shortness of breath largely resolved by the time of her discharge. her oxygen saturations were >95% on room air. . h/o melanoma: outpatient follow up . anemia: likely [**2-27**] hemodilution as hematocrit is back to baseline (35-40 range) at the time of discharge. she had a 8 point hct drop in setting of aggressive ivf (7+ l). also has underlying inflammatory process given infection. she had no evidence of bleeding. . fen: regular diet, electrolytes repleted as

 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm involving the common iliac arteries.

History of Present Illness:
 this patient is a 65-year-old gentleman with a abdominal aortic aneurysm which on ct scan was found to involve the entire visceral segment of his abdominal aorta, his iliac arteries and extended into the distal portion of the descending thoracic aorta. maximum dimensions of the aneurysm were nearly 8 cm in the abdomen and close to 6 mm in the visceral segment. there were large iliac aneurysms as well. due to the extent of the aneurysm, it was felt that a thoracoabdominal approach using partial right heart bypass was the best way to correct this problem. i might add that ct scan also showed a suggestion of an inflammatory component to the aneurysm in the aorta. prior to the surgery the patient understood the risks of surgeries, especially the potential risk of paraplegia, and agreed to proceed. because of the complex nature of this operation, requiring the expertise of both a vascular and cardiac surgeon, and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, i asked dr. [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) 914**] from cardiac surgery to be my co-surgeon for this procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
 mr. [**known lastname 1924**] is a 65 year-old male who underwent a open thooracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair on [**2163-2-15**].  for details of the operation, please refer to the specific operative note. the cross clamp time was 40 minutes and bypass time was 164 minutes.  he was stable immediately postop, however, remained intubated and sedated due to the length of the operation.  he continued to have good urine output and was awake the following day but remained intubated for diuresis.  it was noted that he was unable to move his bilateral lower extremities but able to follow commands with his upper extremities.  a ct torso as well as mri was performed which showed a t8-conus infarct.  neurology was consulted at that time at if was felt that nothing further could be done for the cord infcartion.  he remained stable and was extubated on [**2163-2-19**] and continued to have good urine output.  he had a increase in his creatinine to a peak of 1.9 then started to decrease to 1.6.  on [**2163-2-20**] was found to be unresponsive in the chair and hypotensive. he underwent cpr, shock and a dose of epinephrine.  he was re-intubated and underwent a ct head which was negative for an acute process at that time.  after the code, he required neosynephrine and levophed for blood pressure support.  he became anuric and renal was consulted and thought it was likely atn.  crrt was initiated on [**2163-2-21**].  he continued to require vasopressor support (neo synephrine and vasopressin).  he had atrial fibrillation rhythm on [**2163-2-22**] and his neo synephrine was changed to levophed.  he was given amiodarone and his atrial fibrillation converted to sinus rhythm.  he grew gnrs from his blood cultures on [**2163-2-20**] and was started on vanco/cefepime. his central lines were re-sited complicated by a right pneumothorax requiring a right chest tube.  a ct torso was performed to assess for a source of his gnrs bacteremia/sepsis and was found to have perforated bowel.  he underwent an exploratory laparatomy on [**2163-2-22**] where a left colectomy was performed for ischemic bowel and his abdomen was left open.  he remained intubated and sedated and he was taken back the following day where his abdomen was washed out and further resection of ischemic rectum was resected.  the following day, a third takeback operation was performed with a transverse colectomy, end colostomy. g-j-tube, and abdominal closure with vicryl mesh was performed.  a vac dressing was placed to his abdominal wound.  please refer to the individual operative notes for further details of the procedure.  he remained ctritically ill on crrt and continued to require vasopressor suuport postoperatively.  it was noted that he had a sudden decrease in his platelet count and a hit antibody was sent which eventually was positive.  his lines were exchanged for non-heparin coated lines and all heparin was stopped.  for prophylaxis, he was started on argatroban on [**2163-2-25**].  a surveillance ct torso was performed on [**2163-3-1**] to evaluate for possible abcesses and it was noted that he had a subcapsular liver hematoma.  the argatroban was discontinued at this time.  he continued to require ventilatory support and eventually underwent a tracheostomy on [**2163-3-4**].  he continued to remain neurologically intact as far as his mental status, however, continued to have no ability to move his bilateral lower extremities.  he further continued to be anuric requiring crrt.  another surveillance ct scan to evaluate the subcapsular hematoma was performed on [**2163-3-28**] which showed enlargement despite no anticoagulation medications.  during the week of [**2154-3-6**] he began to have episodes of bradycardia with hypotension.  he was evaluated by cardiology was an eventual permanent pacemaker was placed on [**2163-3-15**].  he continued to have episodes of bradycardia, with the pacemaker functioning properly to maintain his heart rate. crrt was eventaully stopped and her was transitioned to hemodialysis, tolerating it well.  tubefeeds were started once his ostomy started to function and he was maintained on tube feeds via his j-tube.  infectious disease was initially consulted for his gram negative bacteremia and recommended a prolonged course of antibiotics given his risk on continued infections.  on [**2163-3-17**], his open abdominal wound was sufficiently healed and a split-thickness skin graft was performed.  he tolerated the procedure well and the vac dressing for his skin graft was taken down 5 days afterwards to reveal that much of the skin graft had taken.  at this time, he was deemed stable and a rehab screen was initiated.  a passy-muir valve was fitted for his tracheostomy on [**2163-3-23**].  he remained neurologically stable, able to answer questions appropriately. his blood pressure was stable without the need for vasopressor support and he was able to tolerate trach collar for the majority of the day, requiring ventilatory rest at night.  he continued to tolerate his tube feeds through his j-tube , however, continued to remain oliguric requiring hemodialysis. he has been maintined on vancomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole as appropriate antibiotic coverage for bacteroides and [**female first name (un) **]. he remains only with pneumoboots for dvt prophylaxis.",818,"[{""start"":

History of Present Illness:
 this is a 74 year old female with pmh of dm2, asthma, pvd, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, multiple non-healing ulcers and sacral decubitus ulcers presenting for further evaluation of altered mental status and fevers noted by the patient's home vna service. the patient has been admitted 4 times this year for multiple issues including cellulitis and [**last name (un) **]. each time, the patient refuses to go to a rehab facility and instead opts for going home with vna services. the vna observed the patient talking to and asking for family members who have already passed. . in the ed, initial vs were: 97.5 95 111/58 16 95%. she was sleepy but arousable and oriented to person and intermittently to time. stage ii sacral decubitus ulcers with erythematous bases were noted with small ~ 2x2 cm areas with purulent discharge. chronic bilateral lower extremity ulcers for which she completed a course of vancomycin for on previous admissions were erythematous with clean bases. per the ed, her ua was positive and she was treated with ciprofloxacin 400 mg iv for possible uti. she was also given 1 liter of ivf for [**last name (un) **]. she is incontinent of stool and wheelchair bound with chronic foley for urinary incontinence. transfer vitals were 96.9 94 117/49 16 99% 1l. . on the floor, the patient is aroused with wound care, but is otherwise somnolent and will not provide a history . review of sytems: unable to obtain secondary to mental status

Brief Hospital Course:
 74 yo f with dm2, asthma, pvd, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, multiple non-healing ulcers and sacral decubitus ulcers presenting with fever and hypotension concerning for sepsis. . # hypotension, fevers: originally thought to be multifactorial from hypovolemia (from diarrhea and decreased po intake) as well as possible sepsis from various possible sources including urine, sacral ulcers, heel ulcers, and possible c. diff. she received ivf hydration with good response and did not require pressors. stress dose corticosteroids were started given her medication list of taking methylprednisolone daily. a kub showed no evidence of megacolon.  she was continued on abx therapy with vancomycin iv and po, flagyl, cefepime, and daptomycin after consulting with id as well as stress dose steroids with hydrocortisone.  blood and urine cultures were sent and negative. her leflunomide was held as well out of concern for sepsis. her daptomycin, flagyl, and cefepime were discontinued on [**2149-8-25**], given that she continued to be afebrile with negative cultures. she was continued on po vancomycin, as she continued to have watery stools, while c. diff pcr was pending. the c. diff pcr returned as negative on [**2149-8-27**], and the vancomycin was discontinued. her steroids were tapered as her blood pressures stabilized. . however, the patient continued to have sbps in the 90s-low 100s with low urine output given her gi losses and poor po intake. she also frequently lost iv access. the iv team was unsuccessful in placing a picc line. on [**2149-9-9**], the patient's sbp dropped to the 80s. her iv line inflitrated when attempting to give an iv bolus. iv was unsucessful in placing a new line. pt refused an ej line. despite attempting to encourage po intake, pt's sbp dropped to the 70s and she was transferred back to the micu where a subclavian line was placed. . in the micu: it was felt that her low blood pressure was a result of adrenal insufficiency and volume depletion, or possible sepsis from uti. she was started on hydrocortisone. her blood pressure remained stable after she was bolused with fluids. she was initially started on meropenem and vanco for coverage of her possible uti. her urine culture eventually grew e.coli that was pan-sensitive. she was started on ceftriaxone. her dose of hydrocortisone was lowered prior to transfer to the floor. her statin was held (since she refused po's) and her levothyroxine was changed to iv. . iv steroids were initially continued upon transfer back to medical floor. however, given stable bps and no appreciable improvement in stool output, steroids were tapered to her old home dose. she continued to refuse po the majority of the time with little to no po nitrition. albumin was 1.7 at the lowest; inr became elevated and fibrinogen was quite low, which were thought to be [**1-7**] her poor nutritioal status. she was started on tpn with subesquent normalization in her inr and moderated improvement in albumin to 2.3-2.4. as her condition improved she was able to be restarted on verapimil 80 q8hr (she could not take the long acting for b/c pt refused to swallow pill but would take crushed meds in applesauce). . on the day of discharge she was hemodynamically stable and remained afebrile. . # sacral wounds: the patient has multiple deep ulcers on her buttocks with green purulent drainage.  she was treated with abx as above, and had a wound care consult.  she received morphine for pain control. wound care evaluated the wounds and make dressing recommendations. general surgery was consulted for evaluation of possible debridement. they recommended debridement, but the patient refused bedside debridement on multiple occasions. flexiseal was placed to avoid wound contamination by fecal matter. . # diarrhea: originally thought to be infectious in origin; however, as above, c. diff was negative. she continued to have profuse watery diarrhea, with negative stool cultures. she was initially treated with loperamide, which was then changed to lomotil. the diarrhea worsened when her steroids were being tapered. gi was consulted and felt that given the negative infectious workshop, this was likely a flare of her uc. the patient refused colonoscopy, ct scan, as well as empiric steroids. as noted above, steroids were restarted in the micu during her second stay there for hypostension, but were tapered back down to prior home dose when pressures were stable and stool output was not noticably decreased. initially cmv viral laod had been equivocal, but repeat viral load [**2149-9-16**] was 1,590 copies/ml. she was started on iv gancyclovir. one week into her course, viral load had dreased to 834 copies/ml. she was completed a 2 week course of gancyclovir. however, she continues to have loose, dark brown, guaic + flexiseal output. on [**2149-9-24**], hct dropped to 21.3 and she was started on in pantoprazole and transfused 2 units prbcs. he condition improved. after completion of the gancyclovir course, lomotil was restarted as gi and pt flet that this improved symptoms. . #. agitation, hallucinations: she originally presented to the micu with concern from the vna for altered mental status. she was agitated and screaming on admission to the icu. however, on transfer to the medicine floors she began to improve. her alprazolam and trazodone continued to be held. on [**2149-8-28**] she began to have visual hallucinations and was much more agitated. geriatrics and psychiatry were both involved in her care. in addition to modifying her pain regimen, the patient was started on haloperidol, ultimately 1mg in the morning and 2mg at hs. in the micu, olanizpine was found to be effective. upon retrn to the medical floor, olanzipine was kept as a prn, but was very rarely needed; haldol was d/c'ed. while she remained less aggitated, the patient was still at times confused. given the waxing and [**doctor last name 688**] of the pt's mental status and incapacity to make her own decisions, social work was consulted to help establish guardianship. family was [**name (ni) 653**], but no one was willing to be her guardian. after a meeting between the patient's pcp, [**name10 (nameis) **] primary team, and social work, the decision was made to persue a court-issued gaurdian. after several weeks, a court appointed guardian was established ([**name (ni) **] [**name (ni) 95429**] [**telephone/fax (1) 95430**]) who will help to make key care decisions. . #. [**last name (un) **]: patient was admitted with creatinine of 1.4 thought to be pre-renal secondary to dehydration, that improved with fluid resuscitation. nephrotoxins were avoided. on discharge, her creatinine was back to baseline. . # anemia: her hematocrit was at baseline. normocytic, with iron studies suggestive of anemia of chronic inflammation. she had guaiac positive stools, and her aspirin was held. anemia was stable throughout most of the admission. as noted above, she required transfusion of 2 units on [**2149-9-24**] for an hct of 21.3 but required no further transfusions. . # diabetes: she was initially continued on her home nph with a diabetic diet. however, because of low po intake, the patient had episodes of hypoglycemia, so the decisions as made to hold her nph and cover with humalog sliding scale. patient began to refuse sq insulin, so it was decided to include insulin in her tpn to be adjusted on a daily basis along with heparin. . # hypertension: her blood pressure [**date range 4982**] were originally held given hypotension. when pressures were stable, her verapamil was re-started, but patient took it only intermittently.  as her condition improved she was able to be restarted on verapimil 80 q8hr (she could not take the long acting for b/c pt refused to swallow pill but would take crushed meds in applesauce). . pt was discharged to [**location **] rehabiliation facility for continued care.

[**last name (un) **] stim wnl. had brief episode of svt to 180s, resolved with carotid massage. cardiac enzymes showed flat cks, but elevated ck-mb (18), mbi (23.1), and troponin peak to 0.95 in setting of acute on chronic renal failure which was thought to be pre-renal in etiology. intubated on [**3-20**] for worsening mental status and airway protection. infectious w/u thus far negative beyond cxr with ? retrocardiac opacity, fluffy infiltrates, and pleural effusions. he was treated for hap with iv vanc/cefepime, kept on iv cipro, and treated for c. diff with po vanc/flagyl. pressors weaned off on [**3-21**], extubated without event on [**3-22**]. the patient was called out to the medical floor on [**3-24**].  upon transfer to the floor, his vital signs were t: 97.0, bp: 126/65, hr: 93, rr: 20, o2 95% 3l nc. . on the floor, the patient had blood pressures in the 90s systolic, with hr in the 80s-110s, with sao2 persistently in the high 90s. initially, he was found to be more tachycardic, and his outpatient lopressor was re-started to control his atrial fibrillation. the patient had completed an 8 day course of cefepime and cipro for pneumonia, and these antibiotics were discontinued. the patient received 10 mg iv lasix in the am on [**3-25**] to promote diuresis, given that the patient was felt to be intravascularly depleted with third spacing after fluid resuscitation. the patient's wbc had been followed, and over the past 3 days was 23-->31-->28.1.  differential on [**3-24**] showed 91 % neutrophils, 1% bands, 3% lymphs.  all blood and urine cultures were no growth to date, including repeat c. diff. toxin. pt received a 250 ml ns bolus for bp systolic 88. nightfloat called again for bp 73/50s. 1 l ns hung wide open, with pressures transiently bumping to 90s systolic, but bp noted as low as 60s systolic.  on exam, patient was noted to have upper respiratory noises, but sao2 persistently high 90s on 3l. . on arrival to the micu, cuff pressures 70s systolic originally. patient still has cvl from prior micu admit and was started on levophed. arterial line placed which demonstrated bps 140s systolic (on levophed) so levophed was turned off. bps then 110s/50s (map > 60).

Brief Hospital Course:
 a/p: this is a [**age over 90 **] y/o m with h/o recent c diff, cad s/p cabg, atrial fibrillation who who presented initially with supratherapeutic inr and hypotension in setting of c. diff, and who now is re-admitted to the icu with hypotension. . # hypotension: etiology most likely due to sepsis.  pt.'s initial presentation to icu on [**3-16**] was septic shock. differential sources at the time included c diff or pulmonary. pt completed 8 day course of ciprofloxacin and cefepime, continued on flagyl, iv vancomycin and po vancomycin. blood cultures no growth. has r ij placed at admission. patient wa maintained on pressors and it was not possible to wean of due to hypotension. repeat blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum cultures, c. diff were send, however without identification of any pathogens. started zosyn for ? of aspiration event. c diff was treated with flagyl and po vancomycin for 14 days after [**3-24**], and also covered for hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin. patient had pea arrest on [**2136-3-28**]. goals of care discussed with family.  patient was continued to receive full care but no resuscitation if heart stops.  patient remained on levophed, with difficulty with titration as patient dropped pressures with turning.  likely initial trigger was sepsis. echo [**3-29**] no right heart strain, largely unchanged from prior. ce trending downward, likely elevated in setting of cpr and renal failure. . #. acute mental status change: patient not waking up much since extubation.  had ct head on [**3-20**] which was negative for acute intracranial hemorrhage. patient may had difficulty clearing sedatives, although has been off for several days. likely due to sepsis or pre-septic.  continued on flagyl, vanc iv and po. added zosyn for broader coverage. . # respiratory failure: pt initially intubated for respiratory failure, but extubated on [**3-22**].  was reintubated [**2136-3-28**] during code. patient with loud respiratory noises, secretions, coarse breath sounds on exam. empirical treatment for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn. . #

Brief Hospital Course:
 assessment and plan: 85yo f with a h/o choledocholithiasis, htn, renal ca, and dementia who presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory failure and septic shock. . # dyspnea/respiratory failure: admitted with worsening dyspnea on exertion, stable orthopnea. became acutely sob requiring intubation in the ed, likely due to metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation leading to fatigue. repeat cxr showed increased bilateral opacities suggesting pulmonary edema. heart failure was considered her bnp elevation and history of orthopnea, although she has no known heart failure and echo was not particularly concerning for chf ([**name prefix (prefixes) **] [**last name (prefixes) 3841**] dilated, lvef > 55%). viral dfa was negative, pneumonia was less likely in the absence of sputum and change in cxr.  she has smoking history, but no wheezing or co2 retention to suggest copd. ischemia was considered given report of chest pain, although ekg negative and cardiac markers negative. abg showed good oxygenation and patient was switched to psv 10/5 with fio2 40%.  pt was stable on pressure support on the vent and sedation was weaned.  sbts starting [**11-23**] with intention to extubate were unsuccesful (rr into the 40s, tachycardic), likely secondary to volume overload.  she was diuresed with lasix and repeated almost daily sbts continued to show elevated rr and tachycardia.  rsbi was 156 on [**11-29**], but given that she is an elderly female with baseline tachypnea and small tvs, extubation was attempted on [**11-29**] and was successful.  she was quickly weaned down to 2l nc with o2 sats 95-100%.  of note, rsbi is not likely a good indication of this patients suitability for extubation given her baseline tachypnea and small tv and as she did very well s/p extubation with a pre-extubation rsbi of 156. . # septic shock: initial wbc with bandemia, elevated lactate, fever, tachycardia, and pressor requirement. most likely biliary source given cbd dilation with sludge and obstructive lfts in setting on known choledocholithiasis. [**month/year (2) **] was done on [**11-21**] and showed large amounts of sludge and a sludge ball obstructing flow in the cbd.  sludge ball/stone in cbd is approx 3 cm long, so a 5 cm 10 fr pigtail stent was placed around the sludge ball to facilitate drainage until a definitive procedure can be attempted, now scheduled for [**12-28**].  blood cultures showed g positive rods and clostridium species (not perfringens) in anaerobic culture bottles, but have not yet been speciated.  she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including vanc and zosyn on [**11-22**], then narrowed to zosyn with g negative organisms in blood with plan for 14 day course.  a picc was placed on [**11-28**]. pressors were weaned starting [**11-22**] and she has maintained her bp off pressors. metoprolol was started on [**11-29**] and uptitrated. . # atrial fibrillation with rvr. she developed atrial fibrillation on [**11-23**]. she was initially started on iv amiodarone with no good response. her rate remained in 100-120's, and rate control was initiated with metoprolol and diltiazem on [**11-29**]. on [**11-30**], diltiazem was discontinued and metoprolol was uptitrated. on [**12-1**], she spontaneously converted back to normal sinus rhythm. . # arf: likely related to sepsis (atn), as well as hypovolemia from vomiting and diarrhea. baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4. urine lytes: fena: 0.2, feurea: 14.9%. she was rescuscitated with d5 1/2 ns with 3 amps of bicarb followed by ns prn to maintain cvp > 10.  cr returned to baseline by [**11-26**]. . # anion gap acidosis: most likely related to elevated lactate, initially 4.5 improved consistently with ivf, now 1.7. no history of ingestion and no clear offenders on med list. glucose not c/w dka, bun not c/w uremia. . fen: pt was initially kept npo then provided with full fibersource tube feeds at 30 ml/hr.  in anticipation of extubation and question of whether she would be able to pass speech and swallow immediately, her og tube was changed to an ng tube on [**11-27**].  she was evaluated by speech and swallow and her diet changed to regular full, which she tolerated well. . she was called out of the icu on [**11-30**]. floor course: on the floor, she continued to do well. she spontaneously converted from atrial fibrillation back to nsr on [**12-1**]. her oxygen was weaned, and she was seen by physical therapy, who recommended rehab. the remainder of her blood pressure medications from home were held and should be re-added as an outpatient. she was discharged to rehab on [**12-2**] in stable condition, not on oxygen, and tolerating po. . on the floor, she was noted to have frequent stools (3-4 per day). per her daughter, this is chronic and has been going on for months. a c. difficile study on [**11-27**] was negative, and her abdominal exam is benign. this warrants further workup as an outpatient, and she was instructed to make an appointment to see her primary care doctor as an outpatient once

lfts, patient underwent a liver ultrasound to rule out portal vein thrombosis which showed no thrombosis. patient developed worsening renal failure with urine sodium > 20, thus not consistent with hrs. voriconazole was stopped due to progressive liver failure. liver failure was thought to be due to cyclosporine toxicity vs gvhd. patient underwent photopheresis on [**11-3**]. patient has been guiac positive from above and below. he was seen by id who recommended stopping zosyn due to thrombocytopenia, stopping voriconazole due to liver failure, obtaining ct chest and starting levofloxacin for sbp coverage. liver recommended changing csa to rapamycin and obtaining biopsy. . on the morning of his transfer to the icu the patient was hypertensive to 170/108 and heart rate was 60. he was unresponsive but arousable and disoriented. he underwent head ct to r/o bleed that was negative. sinus ct showed hemorrhage from the nasal cavity to the nasopharynx. ct chest showed worsened consolidation in the right upper lobe with cavitation. temperature later that morning was 95.5. id recommended adding ambisome, meropenem and daptomycin. patient had liver biopsy to evaluate cause of worsening liver function. after returning to the floor the intern was called for sbp of 50. patient was unresponsive. he received blood, saline. repeat bp was elevated at 170/100. emergent us showed liver laceration with venous bleed. patient was transfered to the micu. . in the micu ph was 7.23/27/128/12. lactate was 12. o2 sat was 100% on ra. bp was 120s/60s. hr was 120-130. patient was answering questions appropriately and following commands. patient was given 7 units of prbc, one bag of ffp, 2 bags of platelets, 5 liters of saline, 2 liters of lr and 550 cc of d5w hco3. lactate improved to 3.9 and hematocrit to 43. patient was seen by angiography and they felt bleeding had self tamponaded and wanted to watch overnight. . his micu course was complicated by abdominal compartment syndrome secondary to worsening ascites, ileus, and hemoperitoneum s/p liver bx. surgery was consulted and felt the patient was too high-risk for a surgical decompression. he had a 5 l and 3.5 l paracentesis with some reduction in abdominal pressures. course was also complicated by respiratory failure, secondary to narcotics, increased abdominal pressure, and liver failure. he was intubated while in the icu and attempts to wean towards extubation were unsuccessful. his course was also complicated by liver failure, presumed to be secondary to gvhd and was continued on immunosuppresants with minimal change in lfts. other cx included persistent anemia and thrombocytopenia, thought to be [**1-22**] ttp vs [**doctor first name **] from malignant htn. the plasmapheresis did not seem to help with his platelet count or hematocrit. plasmapheresis was d/c'd on [**11-16**]. because he continued to have severe liver disease from presumably gvhd, he was restarted photopheresis soon. in addition, he was intermittently hypothermic and hemodynamically unstable, requiring pressors. etiology was unclear, and patient was continued on broad-spectrum abx. . given the patient's declining status and worsening prognosis, it was decided that the patient be cpr not indicated by the team and family. aggressive care was continued, including ventilatory support and pressors, however the patient's status declined precipitously despite the efforts of the team, and he expired on [**2172-12-12**].",811,"[{""start"": 18, ""end"": 27, ""text"": ""abdominal"",

 confusion/somnolence, low blood pressure

History of Present Illness:
 mr. [**known lastname **] is a 51 yo man with hiv (cd4 of 559 and vl undetectable in [**month (only) 547**]), esrd s/p ddrt in [**2114**], dmi, with 3 prior hospitalizations since [**4-19**] for recurrent rul/rml pneumonia, who presents with hypotension and altered mental status. pt was found to be lethargic and confused by his partner on [**2119-6-13**]. ems was called and his sbp was in the 70s on the field. . he was initially admitted from [**4-19**] to [**4-26**] for right middle lobe pna treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin due to a history of partially treated latent tb. he was discharged and subsequently readmitted on [**5-17**] for fever to 102, hypotension (systolic 70), hypoxia (90% with nrb), and neck stiffness. he was intubated and treated with vancomycin and pressors. he was extubated on [**5-24**] and was treated and monitored for hospital acquired pna, c. diff colitis, and troponin leak. he was discharged on [**6-1**] in good condition. however, pt was readmitted on [**6-3**] with n/v, and inability to tolerate po x 1 day. pt also noted hyperglycemia in the 400s the morning of presentation. he took insulin at home and bg was 150 in the emergency room. pt was thought to have recurrent aspiration pneumonitis and discharged two days later. .

Brief Hospital Course:
 pulmonary: pt was admitted to icu for hypoxia, acidosis, and altered mental status. pulmonary work-up was significant for acidosis on abg on admission. chest ct showed right upper/middle lobe consolidation/atelectasis that appeared consistant with an aspiration event. patient has history over the past three months of waxing and [**doctor last name 688**] infiltrate consistent with reccurant aspiration events. hypersensitivity reaction was in differential and hypersentitivity panel was pending at the time of discharge. patient's rapid resolution of pressor requirement was also in the setting of known automonic instability likely from his longstanding diabetes mellitus. pt was stabilized and transfered to floor. . pt continued to have coughs which improved with time. pt was satting in upper 90s on ra while he was on the floor. it was not certain whether this was non-infectious aspiration pneumonitis vs infectious pna. ct chest showed persistent rml consolidation. given the recurrent nature of pt's sx with periods of resolution in between, it was thought to be likely non-infectious. bcx was negative. pt was taken off of all antibiotics and remained afebrile throughout his hospital stay, with wbc count wnl. pt was noted to have a right sided intrapectoralis fluid collection that was likely due to repeated central line attempts. pt passed swallowing study, although silent aspiration during sleep or during episodes of hypotension could not be excluded. likely scenerio is hypotension leading to somnolence, then aspiration and pulmonary compromise. also in the differential were transplant-associated boop, hypersensitivity pneumonitis. labs for hypersensitivity were pending at the time of discharge. pt was given an acapella device for clearing mucus. pt is to f/u with pulm as outpatient. . altered mental status: patient's mental status rapidly improved with resolution of hyperglycemia and hypotension suggesting it was an issue of metabolic derangement and poor cerebral perfusion. patient had a normal head ct. given the high cd4 count and rapid improvement of mentation, infectious disease did not feel a lumbar puncture was warrented. patient did have an episode of confusion and visual hallucination on the night of [**6-15**], his first night after he was transferred to the floor. he had been given ativan, ambien, amitriptyline together, as he and his partner requested. apparently pt had been taking the three medications at bedtime for many years, although he hadn't taken them in the icu. it was felt that his delirium was due to the medications and possibly due to his new environment on the floor. ambien was discontinued, and ativan was reduced to 0.25-0.5mg at a time. amitriptyline was continued as before. pt did not have another episode of delirium. . fever/leukocytosis: pt had a fever to 100.4 on admission. in the setting of hiv and renal transplant, the initial ddx was wide. pt has had several episodes of similar presentations over the past few months, which were deemed to be of pulmonary origin. ct chest confirmed this dx. he did not have any other evident source of infection. blood cxs and urine cxs were negative. the fevers resolved during the patient's first day of hospitalization and pt remained afebrile through the rest of his hospital stay. . hemodynamic instability: pt was hypotensive to 80s/30s when he arrived in the micu. his hypotension was resonsive to fluids and pressors, which were weaned off during his first evening in the micu. his blood pressure remained labile. all of his usual antihypertensives were discontinued and only metoprolol was begun and titrated up. per dr.[**name (ni) 5907**] (pt's cardiologist) recs, the goal was to titrate up to toprol xl 100 mg daily and varsartan 40 mg daily. pt was discharged on toprol only and pt will discuss adding varsartan when he follows up with dr. [**last name (stitle) **]. . acute renal failure: pt's creatnine bumped to a max of 1.9, with a baseline below 1. he was found to be pre-renal, as evidenced by a fena of 0.5 and hypotension. his cr is returned to baseline quickly. . hyperkalemia: max k 6.7. ekg did not show any changes since prior. it was likely due to pt's renal failure and acidosis. it trended down with fluids, normalization of ph, renal fxn. pt refused kayexelate. . r upper ext swelling: pt complained of r>l upper extremity edema. rue u/s showed old rij clot and new r basilic vein clot. no anticoagulation was indicated at this time, as the old rij had a low risk of dislodging and the new right basilic vein clot was superficial. the primary team consulted [**last name (un) **] endocrine fellow, who did state that diabetic retinopathy is not an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation, although it will increase the risk of retinal hemorrhage. . neuropathic pain: pt stated that he was taking gabapentin 300mg tid, 600 mg qhs, at home, titrating down if pain is less. as gabapentin can have a sedating effect, his dose was decreased with intructions to f/u with pmd. . diarrhea: pt has loose stool/diarrhea at baseline at home and takes tincture of opium 15 drops [**hospital1 **]. he complained of worsening diarrhea while in the hospital (too was not started on admission). pt has h/o + c.diff however most recent stool studies on [**2119-6-14**] were negative. another set of stood studies were sent, which were negative. diarrhea was deemed to be due to diabetic neuropathy, and tincture of opium was started with good effect. . urinary retention: pt c/o urinary retention and had to be straight cathed 2-3 times a day. it was likely due to h/o foley in the icu and diabetic neuropathy. there was no documented history of bph however pt was on flomax at home. pt stated that flomax helped greatly at home, however because of pt's labile bp, finasteride was started instead. pt's partner was shown sterile cath techniques upon discharge and pt was to follow up with a local urologist for evaluation. . dm: pt had very labile bs, with significant hypoglycemia at night. lantus was [**month (only) **]'d to 20 units, and sliding scale was adjusted with smaller doses at bedtime. this fluctuation in bs was likely due to pt's change in diet (ate less than at home). pt was to follow up with an endocrinologist for optimization of insulin regimen. . hiv: stable, haart therapy was continued.",810,"[{""start"": 6438, ""end"": 6443, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]},

 hypotension, gi bleeding

History of Present Illness:
 this is a 65 year old man with a history of colon cancer metastatic to lung, liver, abdominal wall, and ureter who presents with n/v, hypotension.  history is obtained from the patient's daughter and from the medical record.  according to the daughter, the patient had been having n/v for several days and she was worried that he was becoming dehydrated.  apparently today he was less alert and had decreased urine output.  his bp at home was 70/40 and he appeared to be having trouble breathing.  he was also having trouble swallowing his pills, due to being more somnolent. . in the ed, vs: 99.9, hr 130s, sbp 60s, o2sat not initially recorded, but per ed resident 70s-80s. he was reportedly unresponsive at that time.  r groin cordis was placed emergently due to inability to obtain bp.  patient was intubated due to concern that he was aspirating on bloody emesis.  ogt placed, immediately post intubation, draining 2500cc dark red blood, which did not clear with lavage.  rectal revealed guaiac + brown stool.  he was started on ivf (5l ns) and levophed and dopamine.  l ij was later placed for additional access.  he was transfused 3u prbc and 2u ffp.  he was also given vitamin k and protamine (to reverse lovenox), as well as protonix iv.  he was given vancomycin and ceftriaxone. . his abdomen was noted to be rigid (in the setting of known extensive mets and gi bleed), so he underwent ct abdomen/pelvis (in addition to cta chest).  he was then transferred to the micu for further management.  gi was also made aware of the patient.

 65m with metastatic colon cancer admitted with hypotension, gi bleed, pneumonia, and nstemi. hospital course described below by problems: . 1. hypotension: felt to be primarily secondary to sepsis. possible septic sources included uti and lll pneumonia (seen on chest ct).  blood cultures and bal came back positive for [**first name5 (namepattern1) 564**] [**last name (namepattern1) 563**].  gi bleed was felt to be a less likely etiology as his hct was stable.   possible aspiration event prior to intubation.  there may have also been a component of cardiogenic shock given biventricular dysfunction on tte.  he had no pe on cta.  he received aggressive ivf and blood products without improvement in his blood pressure.  he was started on norepinephrine and vasopressin.  id was consulted for fungemia, and he was treated with caspofungin.  he was also maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics.  bronchoscopy [**4-5**] ruled out endobronchial obstruction.  his antimicrobials and pressors were discontinued when he was made cmo. . 2. gi bleed: possible upper gi bleed given + ngl in ed.  could be related to metastatic disease vs. pud, etc.  gi aware.  egd was deferred as hematocrit was stable and gi bleed was felt unlikely to be the primary issue.  his lovenox was held.  he received vitamin k and ffp to correct coagulopathy.  his hematocrit remained stable.  he was maintained iv ppi [**hospital1 **], which was discontinued when he was made cmo. . 3.  respiratory failure: patient intubated due to concern for mental status, aspiration.  also has pneumonia, underlying pulmonary mets.  the patient was to be continued on ventilation until his mental status and sepsis resolved, though the patient was extubated on [**4-9**] after being made cmo. . 4. arf: creatinine improved to 2.9 from 4.2, baseline 1.1-1.3. most likely pre-renal azotemia due to dehydration +/- atn due to hypotension.  he also received iv contrast for cta, so might expect renal function to worsen further despite aggressive hydration he has received so far.  ct showed known r hydronephrosis and hydroureter, stable. . 5. elevated ces/nstemi: resolving.  ck and tnt initially elevated in setting of hypotension and acute renal failure.  ekg with lateral st depressions, and his trop peaked at 0.99. we could not give asa, plavix, or heparin given gi bleed.  not treated with bb given hypotension. . 6. chf: ef 30% with moderate global lv dysfunction and rv dilatation and severe dysfunction.  no prior studies for comparison. . 7. coagulopathy: patient on lovenox at home. liver function also abnormal, with rising lfts, low albumin - could be contributing as well.  received protamine and ffp in ed, as well as vitamin k.  dic panel negative. . 8. lft abnormalities: improving.  likely related to progression of liver mets as well as component of shock liver in the setting of hypotension.  ruq u/s unremarkable . 9. contrast infiltration into axilla: notified by radiology resident of infiltration of 30cc of ct contrast into axilla. there is some risk of skin necrosis from this, although it was a relatively small amount of contrast.  he was evaluated by plastic surgery who recommended elevation of his arm and monitoring for development of compartment syndrome.  no further intervention was required. . 10. code: he was initially maintained as full code, which was confirmed with daughter (hcp). family meeting on [**4-5**] --> daughter wished to continue aggressive care 24-48hrs; family meeting [**4-7**] --> daughter believed her father's wishes were to have aggressive care and live as long as possible.  the patient's primary oncologist spoke with the family on [**4-9**] and explained the patient's very poor prognosis given his advanced disease, multiorgan system failure, and lack of further oncologic treatment options.  his family decided to make him comfort measures only.  he was extubated and started on morphine drip for comfort.  on the floor the patient was maintained on morphine drip, scopalamine and seen by palliative care.  he was comfortable and passed away without problems.  his family was aware and an autopsy was declined",807,"[{""start"": 157, ""end"": 166, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 1368, ""end"": 1375, ""text"": ""abdomen"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 1472, ""end"": 1479, ""text"": ""abdomen"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 4515, ""end"": 4518, ""text"": ""ruq"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 1081, ""end"": 1086, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 598, ""end"": 605, ""text"": ""swallow"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 117, ""end"": 122, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1661, ""end"": 1666, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 150, ""end"": 155, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 4196, ""end"": 4201, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 4436, ""end"": 4441, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 4477, ""end"": 4482, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 842, ""end"": 846, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3594, ""end"": 3601, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3843, ""end"": 3850, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1871, ""end"": 1875, ""text"": "" uti"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3516, ""end"": 3519, ""text"": ""atn"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 482, ""end"": 487, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2195, ""end"": 2201, ""text"": ""cardio"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1507, ""end"": 1512, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1903, ""end"": 1908, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 4686, ""end"": 4694, ""text"": ""necrosis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 797, ""end"": 802, ""text"": ""groin"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 4681, ""end"": 4685, ""text"": ""skin"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 4686, ""end"": 4694, ""text"": ""necrosis"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 797, ""end"": 802, ""text"": ""groin"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 797, ""end"": 802, ""text"": ""groin"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 3103, ""end"": 3114, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1711, ""end"": 1720, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1884, ""end"": 1893, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3198, ""end"": 3207, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 972, ""end"": 982, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2142, ""end"": 2152, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2541, ""end"": 2547, ""text"": ""bronch"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2578, ""end"": 2584, ""text"": ""bronch"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3220, ""end"": 3229, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 144, ""end"": 148, ""text"": ""lung"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 876, ""end"": 884, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3132, ""end"": 3140, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 972, ""end"": 982, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2142, ""end"": 2152, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2116, ""end"": 2126, ""text"": ""aspiration"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3176, ""end"": 3186, ""text"": ""aspiration"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]","{""choices"": [""Urosepsis"", ""Respiratory""]}",None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Abdominal"", ""Gastrointestinal"", ""Bile duct"", ""Skin and soft tissue""]}",4,767,2023-05-23T08:40:26.493685Z,2023-05-23T08:40:26.493720Z,50.387

History of Present Illness:
 83 y/o jehovah's witness with pmh significant for colon ca, dmii, cad (mi in past, refused angioplasty), living at sunrise senior living center, was found to be acutely sob.  ems found pt in severe respiratory distress.  no chest pain.  rr 32 bp: 130/palp.  able to answer questions but responded with one word answers b/c so sob.  put on non-rebreather, sent to [**hospital3 1280**] hospital.  on arrival, bp 152/92 hr 120-130 afib-asystole with agonal respirations.  intubated and responded to atropine, with a hr of 77 with pulse (afib) bp 167/145 then went into svt to 185.  she was given iv lasix, iv nitro gtt, asa, lopressor 5mg iv, and a heparin drip.  sent to icu and found to have st elevation in avr with depressions in v2-v4 and ii, iii, and avf, concerning for right posterior mi.  initially, the pt was in rate-controlled atrial fibrillation, but developed chf-- a dobutamine gtt was started and she was transferred to [**hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.  she was given solumedrol, benadryl, and pepcid for allergy ppx, in cath lab, stented left circumflex artery (occl) with bp drop to 60 systolic upon stenting (good flow)--- changed to dopamine gtt.  stented right coronary artery, and started intra-aortic balloon pump.  she was subsequently transferred to the coronary care unit on iv dopamine at 10 mcg/kg/min.  no gp iia/iiib inhibitors started. of note, she is a jehovah's witness (with form for no transfusions to be given in the chart).  her hcp is [**name (ni) **] [**name (ni) 10076**] ([**telephone/fax (1) 107105**].  her labs at [**hospital1 **] were ck 99, trop i 2.01 (m 0-0.34), bnp 407.

Brief Hospital Course:
 impression: 84 y/o jehovah's witness with h/o colon ca, brain ca, dm ii, cad with mi in past, refused angioplasty, and alzheimer's ds presents with stemi s/p cath with cypher stents to lcx, rca complicated by cardiogenic shock with iabp placement with hypotension on pressors, worsening pulm status, now intubated.  her hospital course was complicated by profound anemia, septic shock, cardiovascular and respiratory failure. the patient died on [**2140-7-15**]. 1.  cardiac:  the patient underwent catheterization on [**2140-7-10**] showing a right dominant system with severe three vessel disease. the lmca was angiographically without significant disease. the lad was proximally occluded and was filled by left-to-left and right-to-left collaterals. the mid and distal lad was severely diffusely diseased. the proximal lcx was without flow limiting stenoses and filled a moderate sized om1. the mid lcx was occluded prior to a large om2. the rca was a large dominant vessel with a mid 80% stenosis and a 50% stenosis at the origin of the pl branch. there was a considerable amount of right to left collaterals to the lad. she demonstrated severe pulmonary hypertension (pa mean 47 mmhg). the left and right sided filling presures were severely elevated (ra mean 20 mmhg, rvedp 19 mmhg, pcw mean 37 mmhg). the cardiac output was normal with low systemic resistance (co 6.2 l/min, ci 3.3 l/min/m2). her final cath diagnoses were: 1. three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. severe left and right sided diastolic dysfunction 3. severe pulmonary hypertension. she was placed on iabp post cath, which was weaned 1 day post cath.  as she was hypotensive post procedure, she was started on pressors.  it was not clear the etiology of her hypotension her first night post cath, as her ci was fine, but she was persistently 70s-90s/50s-60s with cool, clammy extremities and peripheral vasodilation.  cardiogenic shock was considered.  she was started on dopamine gtt and maxed out on dosage with persistent map in 40s-50s, then given dobutamine, which was weaned.  as it was then felt she was not likely in cardiogenic shock, she was begun on levophed with good response in her mean arterial pressure (map >60).  at this time, however, she spiked a temperature to 102, was pan cultured, and started on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.  her shock was most likely secondary to sepsis.  a map of >60 was kept during her stay in the unit, supported by pressors and fluid boluses.  as she is a jehovah's witness, she would not accept transfusions of prbcs, so epoetin and ferrous sulfate were begun as adjunctive therapy.  she was also started on aspirin, plavix, a statin, and integrillin gtt for her coronary disease.  despite aggressive measures, the patient acutely decompensated on [**2140-7-15**] in the setting of profound anemia, cardiovascular and respiratory failure, and sepsis. . 2.  septic shock: though the pt had a cardiac index of 3.3 in the cath lab, post-cath the pt seemed peripherally vasodilated.  initially, the pt was afebrile, and it was thought her low systemic vascular resistance was secondary to medications for intubation, however, during the night post-cath, she spiked a temp to 102, and was pan-cultured with blood cx x2 sent, ua and urine cx sent, with endotracheal cx sent.  [all blood cultures during her stay ([**7-10**], [**7-14**], and [**7-15**]) were negative.  all urine cultures sent during her stay ([**7-10**] and [**7-14**]) were negative.  an endotracheal culture from [**7-10**] grew coag positive s. aureus.  a sputum cx from [**2140-7-10**] grew sparse oropharyngeal flora.]  a cxr during the night of her admission to the ccu  demonstrated extensive bilateral perihilar infiltrates involving virtually all segments of the lungs.  she was started empirically on iv vancomycin and iv zosyn for broad coverage (started [**2140-7-11**]) and these meds were continued throughout her stay.  she was begun on pressors to maintain a map of >60.  despite aggressive measures with ivf boluses, pressors, and iv antibiotics, the pt expired [**2140-7-15**], as stated above. . 3.  profound anemia secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding with bloody secretions in et tube after iabp removal.  no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed on abdominal/pelvic ct scans.  it was unclear the precise etiology of the pt's source of bleed.  she developed guiaic positive stool during her stay, and heparin gtt was held.  initially, on arrival to ccu, the pt had bloody secretions in the et tube, which persisted for several days, then resolved.  her health care proxy was notified of her profound anemia, and because she is a jehovah's witness, no tranfusions were given to the patient to correct her anemia. instead, fluid boluses with pressors were given to maintain her map.  iv ferrous sulfate, and epoetin was given to the pt. blood draws were minimized and only necessary labs were obtained. the pt's hct dropped from  36 on [**7-10**] to 20.5 on [**7-11**].  a ct scan of abd/pel did not reveal a retroperitoneal bleed post-cath.  her iabp removal was not complicated by bleeding in excess of normal to explain her acute drop in hct.  on [**7-13**] her hct was 14.7, and had held steady in the 14-16 range for three days.  she developed bloody stools four days post-admission, and gi was consulted.  a nasogastric lavage was performed and was negative.  her hemolytic workup was negative.  her stool was guiaic positive and maroon in color. it was felt she had a lower gi bleed, however she was not stable enough to undergo colonoscopy.  her heparin gtt was discontinued.  her map was supported as stated above.  on the day of her death, her hct was 14.0.  her health care proxy was informed of all events and procedures during her stay, and was given updates as to her hct and measures being taken to support her map. . 4.  respiratory: the pt's cxr was read as ""extensive bilateral perihilar infiltrates involving virtually all segments of the lungs."" post-cath, she was intubated and sedated on mechanical ventilation.  she was unable to be weaned from the vent secondary to hypoxia.  her cxr improved somewhat during her stay, with [**2140-7-12**] cxr showing mild-to-moderate residual pulmonary edema, largely basal, unchanged since [**7-11**], having improved dramatically since [**7-10**], with leftward mediastinal shift reflecting left lower lobe atelectasis, accompanied by persistent small left pleural effusion.  cxr on [**2140-7-15**] demonstrated multiple bilateral asymmetrical areas of hazy opacity, likely from resolving pulmonary edema. her small bilateral effusions and residual lower lobe atelectasis remained.  she remained on broad spectrum iv antibiotics throughout her admission. . 6.  dm type ii:  her blood sugars were well controlled with sliding scale insulin, and fingersticks were checked qid. . # decreased mental status:  a head ct was performed to rule out intracranial bleed as a cause of her depressed mental status and inability to be weaned from the vent (a central cause for respiratory depression/hypoxia was considered) and in the setting of possible systemic hypoperfusion given her septic picture, and was negative for intracranial bleed or mass effect or any acute abnormality.  the pt remained minimally responsive and sedated and intubated throughout her stay. . 7.  seizure d/o no seizures occurred during her admission.  her dilantin level at [**hospital1 **] was 10.6.  we restarted dilantin on admission. . 8.  alzheimer's ds: her aricept was held in light of her critical status. . 9.  depression: her zoloft was held in light of pt's unstable status. she remained intubated and sedated throughout her stay, only minimally responsive on sedation. . 10. code:  full code, although her health care proxy requested at admssion that he wanted to be notified if there was futility/no benefit to further aggressive measures.  the health care proxy was communicated with nearly every day by housestaff physicians, rns in the ccu and the attending physician as to the pt's prognosis, status, and measures being taken in her care. he was involved in all decision making. .",806,"[{""start"": 5999, ""end"": 6008, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 5979,

Brief Hospital Course:
 88yo male with history of coronary artery disease, chf, dm, and prior dvt admitted with septic shock. . 1. septic shock hypotension is likely related to sepsis. the source of his sepsis is likely related to klebsiella and enterococcus found on blood cx, although the source of the gnr and enterococcus is unclear. his blood pressure improved rapidly with broad spectrum antibiotics and was weaned off of pressors within 48 hours.  he was originally started on broad spectrum antibiotics which were narrowed early on to ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  his enterococcus can back sensitive to ampicillin and he was switch from vancomycin to ampicillin on [**2160-6-1**].  his ceftriaxone's last dose is due on [**2160-6-11**].  his last dose of ampicillin was due on [**2160-6-11**]. . 2. ? pneumonia his

weaned off to room air at the time of discharge. he is being treated with ceftriaxone and ampicillin as detailed above. . 3. transaminitis the patient had mildly elevated transaminases and total bilirubin. priors from [**4-15**] were within normal limits. there is concern that he could have mild hepatic congestion given his chf. his transaminitis may also reflect systemic infection. these should be redrawn to ensure that they normalize. on ct scan his liver showed two stable hypodensities which were likely cysts.  his ceftriaxone could be contributing to his increased ap. . 4. thrombocytopenia on review of omr, he had prior plts in the low 100's. his platelets nadired at 73 and were 123 on the day of discharge. . 5. leukopenia during his admission, his white blood cell count declined from 12 to 3. the etiology of this decline was thought likely related to sepsis or medication effect given the multiple different antibiotics he received.  his leukopenia normalized prior to discharge.  his wbc count should be drawn again in 1 week. . 6. chf, chronic, diastolic: his b-blocker and lasix were held in the setting of hypotension. they were restarted prior to

hospital course and felt she likely had a poor prognosis given her age.  the patient remains non-verbal without use of right side. a repeat ct showed evolving area of infarct but no evidence of bleed. a family meeting was held when she was on the general medicine floor (on [**2139-4-10**] with the neurology team, palliative care team, and primary geriatric team to discuss goals of care. the family is still uncertain about goals of care but determined she would not want any invasive procedures (picc, tee, mri, frequent lab draws) at this point. they would like a couple of weeks to observe her progress and reassess her goals of care. she was continued on metoprolol for blood pressure control (with prn hydralazine through the ng tube) and was given lovenox (as opposed to coumadin) for anticoagulation to avoid need for frequent lab draws. if the family decides to pursue a more aggressive management, neuro made the following recommendations: obtain tte and duplex carotids, keep ldl<70, check hga1c, start coumadin and get mri head to evaluate extent of damage. . # cardiac: a. chf:  the patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction, and was on losartan and metoprolol during the hospital course.  in the icu she had had recurrent problems with episodes of hypertension leading to desaturation/wheezing, requiring tight blood pressure and volume status control.  she received iv hydralazine prn, iv lasix to maintain negative fluid balance. losartan was discontinued due to stroke above, and her blood pressure was managed with a goal bp 140-160, and close monitoring of volume status. on the floors she was continued on metoprolol with po hydralazine prn to keep blood pressure within goal range. . b. rhythm:  the patient was initially in atrial fibrillation on presentation (no history of atrial fibrillation per records), then was in normal sinus rhythm during her early hospital course.  she went back in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of acute stroke - at that time, she received dig load in attempt to maintain blood pressure, but she was not continued on dig.  she was maintained on metoprolol, low dose, and spontaneously converted back to normal sinus rhythm within 24 hours.  she was not started on coumadin for fear of converting her large ischemic stroke into a hemorrhagic stroke. once the repeat head ct came back negative for hemorrhage there was discussion of restarting her on coumadin but the family declined as this would require frequent blood sticks for monitoring inr and she had very poor access. she was started on sc lovenox instead. on the floors her rate was well-controlled on metoprolol though for her rhythm she did go in and out of nsr and a-fib. . # uti:  the patient presented as above, and the u/a in ed was positive, though no cultures were sent at that time.  repeat u/a after 24hrs of antibiotics was negative, and culture was negative.  she completed a 7 day course of levofloxacin. . #. respiratory distress overnight on [**4-14**]: the patient triggered for hypoxia and respiratory distress, was felt to be volume overloaded v. aspiration and received 40mg po lasix and 25mg po hydral. she diuresed 3 l and her o2 sat improved from requiring 6lo2 to her baseline 3l o2 requirement. she looked very comfortable the next day w/some crackles on exam so she was given another 40mg po lasix. she subsequently appeared euvolemic and comfortable. she had peg placed given risk for aspiration. she has been on aspiration precautions. i/o should be closely monitored. . rash- the patient developed linear lesions with pustules on r scapula with a few satelite lesions on l. could be pustular zoster though dfa was negative (culture pending). derm was consulted, she was put on zoster precautions and treated with 7 days of acyclovir 500mg 5x/day per ngt for 7 days total (started [**2139-4-13**]), finished today [**4-20**]. please follow up viral culture and monitor clinically for signs of further dissemination (has had none in house).",793,"[{""start"": 1352, ""end"": 1363, ""text"": ""hemodynamic"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 5729, ""end"": 5733,

 fevers, cough with sputum

History of Present Illness:
 this is a 41 y.o. female with history of hiv (last cd4 count 160 per ed records, viral load > 100,000 in [**2115**] per omr), history of ivdu, s/p tricuspid endocardititis with bioprosthetic valve replacement who presents for evaluation of fevers, malaise and 2 days of chest pain, and cough productive of brown sputum. patient is poor historian, answers questions but not completely and requires frequent redirection.  per ed records, she complains of intermittent chest discomfort, productive cough with brown sputum, fevers, reportedly to 104 at home. there was no history of recent ivdu per patient.  ed record does report histor of possible recent inhaled crack cocain use.

Brief Hospital Course:
 micu course: in the [**name (ni) **], pt was found to be afebrile. patient had lactate drawn and was 4.4, so she was started on sepsis protocol, and right ij was placed.  she received 3 litres intravenous normal saline, and subsequent lactate improved to 1.4.  patient was given ceftriaxone/azithromycin for possible infiltrate on chest x-ray concerning for pneumonia, after blood cultures x 3 and urine cultures were sent.  pt found to have uti. given her hiv history, she was also given treatment dose loading of tmp/smx. to both fungal and uti coverage.  further, given concern for possible endocarditis, vancomycin and gentamicin were started. pt had tte which did not show a vegetation on her valves.  given negative [**location (un) **] criteria pt no longer needed coverage for endocarditis. pt was switched ot unasyn and azithromycin. pt also had concern for tb so pt placed on isolation and 3 sputum cultures were ordered. given pts extensive polysubstance abuse, she had tox screens done. she had a positive urine cocaine screen. there was concern for drug withdrawal. pt also had 2 code purples due to agitated violent behavior. pt was found to have 2 crack pipes and a spring loaded knife in her possesion. pt started on 1:1 sitter. psych evaluated and she was placed on standing ativan and haldol. in addition, pt was noted to have multiple rashes on extremities. derm was consulted. [**first name8 (namepattern2) 6**] [**doctor first name **] was positive. further workup for rheumatologic disorders begun.  additionally she was treated for sebborheic dermatitis and psoriasis. pt had complained of bilateral eye pain and was seen by optho who felt that her pain may be secondary to old stable corneal scars. she was started on lubricant drops. . [**hospital ward name 121**] 3 course: pt was transferred to the floor on [**8-31**], and immediately triggered a code purple before even being seen, and triggered 2 more that evening, appearing very anxious.  overnight pt was managed somewhat with ativan and haldol, but in the am started setting off code purples again.  a review of her chart revealed that she had not been on methadone as she stated she was on for maintainance therapy.  she [**doctor last name 8196**] admitted she gets methadone, 10mg a day, from a friend of hers that has low back pain.  she has been taking this for at least 3 years.  at that time, on [**9-1**] pt was started on methadone 10mg a day and after that point did not cause another code purple. from an infectious standpoint pt improved qiuckly and did not have a cough at all on the floor, remained afebrile and without an elevated white count.  the thinking was that the infection most likely was an atypical pneumonia.  on [**9-2**] pt was swtiched from unasyn to augmentin (in addition to azithromycin). on [**9-3**] am, her third tb smear returned negative and pt was taking off isolation precautions.  upon dischrge id's recommendation was to complete therapy for pneumonia (aspiration vs. cap) with a course of augmentin for 10-14 days. pt was sent out on a 4 day course of abx for a total of 10 days. on [**9-1**] pt was noticed to have an elevated potassium to 5.2. this lab was thought to be due to hemolysis but the following day the k came back at 5.5, recheck at 5.5 in the pm.  this was thought to be possibly a drug related effect due to tmp-smx although unlikely given long-term use.  per id it may have been due to unasyn which was d/c'd that morning.  tmp-smx was also decreased to normal strenght.  renal insufficiency is another possibility given that bun was uptrending and creatinine was 1.0 which is a little bit high given her size.  she was promoted to take in oral ingestion of fluids, recheck unchanged.  the following am the labs were reassuring, and included k 4.9, bun 23 (stable), creat (1.1). pt's rashes remained stable and improved slowly on the floor. rheum labs were still pending at discharge.  i would encourage pcp [**name initial (pre) **]/or derm to follow-up on these do decide if need further work-up, treatment or a rheum consult. she had no further eye pain. the plan for discharge was for the patient to go to the women's hope program, but the bed fell through at the last minute; therefore pt was instructed to call the women's hope program after discharge to schedule a bed.  this was discussed with the social worker and care management for substance abuse treatment. pt was scheduled appointments with her pcp for hiv treatment and follow-up as well as for her methadone maintainance for previous ivdu.  pt was given 2 days worth of methadone and klonopin as she had been on these drugs long term.  i strongy recommended against continued use of a benzodiazipine such as klonopin and encouraged a discussion with pt's pcp regarding the need for methadone maintainance preferrable with a methadone [**hospital 8197**] clinic.",792,"[{""start"": 4329, ""end"": 4333, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 4292, ""end"": 4299, ""text"": ""renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1219, ""end"": 1223, ""text"": "" uti"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1320, ""end"": 1324, ""text"": "" uti"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1176, ""end"": 1181, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1796, ""end"": 1801, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 221, ""end"": 230, ""text"": ""tricuspid"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 344, ""end"": 349, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 540, ""end"": 545, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1109, ""end"": 1114, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1372, ""end"": 1384, ""text"": ""endocarditis"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1563, ""end"": 1575, ""text"": ""endocarditis"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2132, ""end"": 2136, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 4605, ""end"": 4609, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 2344, ""end"": 2354, ""text"": ""dermatitis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1136, ""end"": 1145, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3486, ""end"": 3495, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3745, ""end"": 3754, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 26, ""end"": 31, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 360, ""end"": 365, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 569, ""end"": 574, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3339, ""end"": 3344, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3756, ""end"": 3766, ""text"": ""aspiration"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,Urosepsis,"{""choices"": [""Endocarditis"", ""Skin and soft tissue"", ""Respiratory""]}",4,752,2023-05-23T08:21:53.942623Z,2023-05-23T08:21:53.942651Z,44.721

lactate of 4.4. patient with hx of c diff, serratia and mrsa bacteremia in the past. during a previous admission, pt had mrsa bacteremia but no source was identified. no hx of diarrhea.  blood, sputum cultures sent.  pt is anuric so no urine culture. patient however with multiple sources of infection, including sacral decub ulcers, dry gangrene in both feet, tracheostomy and g-tube insertion sites. pt sx's initially improved dramatically with supportive therapy. cultures returned pseudomonas from sputum and begun on meropenem on [**7-28**]. ct + mri of sacral and posterior-tibial decubs showed no evidence of osteomyelitis. patient initially failed [**last name (un) 104**]-stim test and completed a five day course of stress dose steroids. regarding sacral decub ulcers, plastics was consulted

 patient's hd catheter was removed when patient was found to have vre. . patient also with hx of aortic annular abscess with serratia and ? of endocarditis at [**location (un) 5871**] and is chronically treated with levoquin. vasc [**doctor first name **] performed a partial amp/debridement of the l great toe in the setting of dry gangrene. wound cultures from the tissue returned pseudomonas as well which showed resistance to meropenem. vasc surgery recommended amputation with bka due to gangrneous toes bilaterally. family refused intervention. . pt had a recurrent episode of vre in her blood and a pna with psuedomonas and klesiella. this was again treated with meropenem and amikacin for a 14 day course. she was also started on daptomycin for recurrent vre in her blood for a 14 day course. . # lethargy: patient with lethargy throughout her course, likely secondary to patient's sepsis. head ct was negative for any intracranial hemorrhage or mass. this improved and pt was at her baseline at time of discharge. . # resp: s/p trach, on vent at home with settings of assist control 450x22xpeep of 5x60%. pt. remained mostly on home vent settings throughout hospital stay. oxygenating well on fio2 of 60%.  she had her peep increased to 8 [**2-21**] increased pleural effusions due to volume resuscitation during bouts of sepsis/gi bleed.  also, during her acute gi bleed, her rate was increased to help offset a lactic acidosis that occured [**2-21**] the large amounts of blood products she received. other than this her vent settings have remained stable. will likely be

to receive any further treatment. patient's coumadin and heparin drip have been held while concern for active bleeding. pt then had active gi bleeding and all anticoag has been held for recurrent gib while on anticoagulation. . # gib: pt had bright red blood per ostomy and gi service was consulted. pt found to have petecial lesion in residual colon, no active bleeding. egd was negative. attempted to restart anticoagulation however pt continued to have gib when on heparin. on one occasion, a bleeding vessel was found at the stomal site and a stitch was placed by surgery, with no recurrent bleeding from that vessel.  decision made with gi and cardiology to hold anticoagulation. . # lactic acidosis: pt was found to be hypotensive to the 50s-60s several times during her hospital course.  an arterial line was placed for better monitoring and revealed a difference in cuff pressure of 30 points.  lactate was elevated to 10, which was attributed to linezolid.  this was discontinued and she was started on daptomycin for vre bacteremia.  she should not receive linezolid again and it was added to her allergy list. . # dm: patient with very poorly controlled blood glucose at home. patient's blood glucose was managed during this hospitalization with the help of [**last name (un) **]. she was placed on an insulin drip during her intermittent sepsis, as her sugars were difficult to control.  prior to discharge, her insulin regimen was transitioned to glargine at 7 untis qam and an agressive insulin sliding scale. . # thrombocytopenia: pt had progressive thrombocytopenia

[**last name (stitle) **] earlier this was and was supposed to come in for labs, but didn't come monday or tuesday because he was too tired to leave the house. complaining to wife that he cannot lower or raise his body from the toilet, and she finds that he is incontinent of loose stools in the bathroom. she has also found him on the floor in the bathroom two nights in a row, after a fall. he told her his legs gave out underneath him. this morning she also witnessed hematuria, which he denied to her. pt himself reports 1 week of anorexia & nausea, and vomiting x1. finally came in to get labs drawn this am with family's urging and physical assistance to transfer from house to car. they returned home and shortly thereafter were called by dr.[**name (ni) 37751**] office with instructions to immediately stop hcv treatment and lasix and report to the ed. . wife notes transient episodes of confusion since [**2111**], when he quit his job unexpectedly, passed out at home, was taken to local ed and found to be very confused. has not worked since that time. rarely leaves the house except to occasionally drive son to train in the morning. she thinks his mood today is at baseline. . regarding recent liver function, meld score this past spring noted to improve to 14 with compensated cirrhosis with a child's-[**doctor last name 14477**] score of 7. in view of this, he elected for antiviral therapy with a protease inhibitor, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin. he completed two weeks of pegylated interferon and ribavirin as alead in phase followed by telaprevir, pegasys, and ribavirin. he only completed a two week lead in phase rather than four week lead in phase as he developed thrombocytopenia with a plateletcount dropping to 70. . he was seen in follow-up in [**7-17**]. at that time he had completed two weeks of telaprevir, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin with hcv viral load decreasing from 1,690,000 international units per ml to 586 international units per ml. noted minor complications to treatment including thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 92. in addition, his bilirubin had increased from 1.9 to 3.8 and creatinine has increased from 1.2 to 1.5. in view of the increasing creatinine, his dose of lasix was reduced to 20 mg from 40 mg daily. he was noted to be feeling well at that time.

Brief Hospital Course:
 57m w/ chronic hepatitis c cirrhosis on the liver transplant list, undergoing outpatient hcv eradication treatment with interferon/ribavirin/telapivir now p/w profound weakness and clinic labs concerning for worsening liver and kidney function, found to have klebsiella urosepsis with good resolution on iv antibiotics. . #septic shock. pt presented with profound weakness but stable vs, no hypotension or decrease in urine output, no fever or tachycardia. wbc was elevated to 14. in this context, lab abnormalities showing thrombocytopenia, anemia and [**last name (un) **] were most concerning for possible adverse effect of recently-initiated telapivir therapy. patient was very ill-appearing on initial exam, but given strong concern for drug effect, unremarkable ua, and cxr without e/o pna, no empiric antibiotics were started. blood cultures were sent with admission labs. late on hd1, patient spiked a fever to 101, developed worsening mental status (only oriented to self), and sbp 80s (baseline 1wk prior was 110s). patient received 2l ns w/o change in bp. given concern for infection, patient was started on ceftriaxone and flagyl, which was shortly thereafter broadened to vanco and zosyn. given potential for rapid patient decompensation as well as concern regarding available nursing resources, patient was transferred to the icu for further management. . in the icu, non-invasive bp were [**location (un) 1131**] as low as 50. an a-line was placed for more accurate bp monitoring. initially, pressures were 80s-90s on the a-line, but dropped to the 70s. peripheral dopamine was started and a right ij cvl was placed and pressors were changed to norepi. abx were continued, and bcx from the floor grew out gram negative rods. renal and liver both recommended albumin for volume resuscitation. mental status improved with improvement in blood pressures.  pressures improved and pt was weaned off pressors and returned to the floor for further care. . after floor transfer, urine and blood cultures grew out pan-sensitive klebsiella, so antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone. the patient continued to improve significantly each day, such that on hospital day 5 he was able to sit up in bed, converse easily, and passed physical therapy evaluation to be able to get out of bed without assistance to the bathroom. he was noted to still have [**3-25**] residual weakness in all 4 extremities, which may benefit from rehabilitation. he has a picc and will continue to receive ceftriaxone iv for a 2-week course, last day [**2121-8-17**]. . # hcv cirrhosis/esld on antiviral therapy. pt has end-stage liver disease with chronically elevated lfts, inr, and thrombocytopenia. genotype i hcv has been resistant to previous rounds of interferon therapy. prior to this admission patient was doing well, and, given his transplant listing, was started on outpatient viral eradication therapy with interferon, ribavirin and telapivir. these medications may explain for some of the anemia, thrombocytopenia, and chronic weakness the patient experienced even prior to his recent acute decline in the 4-5 days prior to admission, and may have left him susceptible to infection. indeed, per outpatient records telapavir was started earlier than had been planned because the patient already showed worsening thrombocytopenia on interferon/ribavirin. all antiviral medications were stopped by his outpatient hepatologist immediately prior to admission, and were held in the hospital too. meld was 30 on admission, 22 by hospital day 5 as labs improved; this laboratory improvement mirrored clinical improvement. hcv titer 150 on admission, lfts elevated on admission but trending down prior to discharge. . # acute kidney injury. pt presented with elevated creatine which was concerning for kidney hypoperfusion versus hepatorenal syndrome, in the context of worsening lfts and elevated tbili. thought to be pre-renal, most likely from sepsis. maximum creatinine was simultaneous with fever and hypotension onset, 2.9, trending down thereafter. normal renal us. he received iv fluid resuscitation with albumin in the icu, but maintained normal bp without fluids after floor transfer. also taking good pos and making urine well. . #altered mental status patient was aox3 but had difficulty communicating and had declining mental status on the evening of admission. improved markedly with antibiotic therapy. family provided history of possible falls at home prior to admission; head ct was without evidence of trauma or bleed. when alert, patient was able to clarify history of falls - he felt legs becoming weak and lowered himself to the ground, no loss of consciousness and no head strike. he was maintained on home lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy prophylaxis. . # macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia. ddx for anemia was broad in this patient: red cell underproduction, bleeding, consumption all possibe. in our patient anemia likely secondary to baseline liver/kidney destruction as well as ribavirin-induced hemolysis.  patient has had gradual drop in hct since [**5-31**], roughly around the time that hcv treatment was initiated. hemolysis is known side effect of ribavirin. the more acute drop in recent weeks likely reflects patient's concurrent renal impairment as renal excretion of ribavirin, so any renal impairment will increase serum levels (particularly within erythrocytes). as the usual half life of ribavirin is 120 days, the presence of renal failure promotes severe ongoing haemolysis. patient received 1 blood transfusion of 1u prbc for a hct 20.6, with resultant rise of hct to only 22.6. he also received 1u prbc on the day of discharge, for a hct of 20.8;

History of Present Illness:
 73 year old female with history of cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy (and portal hypertension, hypersplenism) with multiple recent admissions ([**date range (1) **]/[**2151**]) who presented to [**hospital6 5016**] with fatigue, shortness of breath, wheezing, pruritis on [**2151-4-6**]. she denied any nausea or vomiting, sick contacts. . at osh, she was gently hydrated with normal saline and her diuretics were discontinued. her rifaximin was initially discontinued given concern it was causing her pruritis but then resumed. her lactulose was continued but her ammonia level continued to rise and finally decreased to 21 on [**2151-4-11**] and 19 on [**2151-4-14**]. her liver function tests rose gradually from 50s to 60s and tbili rose from 5.2 to 6.8. the patient was treated with vitamin k subcutaneously without much improvement in her inr (1.9-2.5). the decision was to transfer her liver care and work-up/second opinion to [**hospital1 18**]. regardless the outcome, family is supportive and very involved and would not want [**hospital1 1501**] placement; they would rather take the patient home with them. . renal was consulted for her acute on chronic renal failure, which was felt due to hypervolemia from liver cirrhosis extravascularly, hypovolemia from furosemide intravascularly. she was fluid restricted to one liter and her sodium level gradually corrected 137 by time of transfer. she was resumed on her spironolactone by time of discharge without drops in her serum sodium. . the patient was noted to have mild facial asymmetry on [**2151-4-11**] and then swallowing dyskinesia [**2151-4-13**]. ct head showed advanced periventricular subcortical white matter changes unchanged from ct head [**2151-3-22**]. mri was attempted for ?cva but patient could not cooperate with the exam; suboptimal mri imaging suggested no definite acute ischemic event. neurology was consulted, who felt the patient's oral lingual dyskinesia was most likely metabolic +/- central pontine myelinolysis. eeg showed moderate-to-severe generalized cortical dysfunction. speech and swallow felt the patient had moderate-to-severe pharyngeal dysphagia, with impaired respiratory swallow coordination, premature spillage into pharynx. thus, the patient was made npo except for medications in applesauce and started on maintainance fluids. ngt was not placed given concern for esophageal varices. . of note, family recounts that her liver disease was first noticed ~4 years ago. the patient had been sent to hematology/oncology for lab abnormalities (?anemia/thrombocytopenia). eventually (~one year later), ultrasound showed liver disease (?nodular liver w/ cirrhosis). she was referred to dr. [**last name (stitle) 89845**] at [**hospital1 2025**], whom she saw ~twice a year for management of her liver disease. the family, however, did not feel anything had been done aside from diagnosis of ""cryptogenic cirrhosis."" in particular, no egd had ever been performed. colonoscopy was performed which showed a few polyps (biopsied, cancer negative) and hemorrhoids. approximately one year ago, the patient started decompensating from her liver disease, with encephalopathy. she has been hospitalized multiple times since spring [**2150**] for this and was noted since ~ [**2150-8-7**] to have worsening renal function (baseline 1.3-1.5). in the last 2-3 weeks, the patient was found for the first time to have hyponatremia (not a problem before). . upon arrival to [**hospital1 18**], the patient was resting comfortably in bed. moderately engagable, watching television. . ros: positive per hpi; patient unable to answer rest of ros

Brief Hospital Course:
 ms. [**known lastname **] is a 73 year old woman with cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy likely ascites who presented as a transfer from an osh for evaluation and treatment of altered mental status. . floor course: # altered mental status: originally the differential diagnosis included hepatic encephalopathy, central pontine myelinolysis, cva, hyponatremia, steroid induced psychosis, and hospital induced/icu delirium. hepatic encephalopathy was thought to be likely contributing as worsening mental status decline mirrored lactulose cessation at the osh (due to poor po intake)and family reports that the facility initially gave the patient less lactulose than worked at home (30ml tid vs 60ml tid). hyponatremia was also likely playing a role, but correction at the outside facility did not seem to improve her mentation. neuro consult was obtained.  central pontine myelinolysis was initially thought to be a possibility given her peculiar tongue movements, but there was no clear evidence of rapid sodium rise and no evidence on head ct. mri was limited by motion and neither ruled in or ruled out such a finding. lactulose was started at 30ml q2h with copious stool production (~10 bm/day) which did nothing to clear her mental status over her first 3 days of admission. . # cirrhosis: diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis is a diagnosis of exclusion. serologies were reportedly negative, but no biopsy was performed. has been on diuretics since ~1 year ago (presumably for ascites). no egd as of yet. diagnostic para negative for sbp. hepatitis serologies were repeated which were negative. autoimmune serologies were repeated and [**doctor first name **] was positive at 1:160. . # hypernatremia: upon admission, ms. [**known lastname **] was eunatremic. upon the third day of her hospital stay, ms. [**known lastname **]' sodium was found to be 152 likely secondary to copious stool production in the setting of lactulose administration. d5w was started. . # [**last name (un) **] superimposed on ckd: creatinine of 2.2 above baseline of 1.5. likely secondary to decreased effective circulating volume as above. also question of hepatorenal syndrome. . # asthma: ms. [**known lastname **]' initial reason for admission to the osh was shortness of breath which has been treated with steroids and albuterol. she was methylpred 60mg daily upon transfer. she is currently without respiratory distress on room air, and no focal infiltrates on exam or cxr, until her fourth day of admission, when she became hypoxic with spo2 85% on ra. due to concern for fluid overload and wet appearance on cxr, lasix was started. unfortunately, ms. [**known lastname **] became progressively more hypoxemic and was found to have a large diffuse infiltrates on cxr. ms. [**known lastname **] was transferred to the icu where she was intubated. . icu course: patient was transferred to the icu for acute respiratory failure requiring urgent intubation and mechanical ventillation.  she became hypotensive and levophed was started.  there was concern that she developed septic shock initially thought to be due to a pneumonia and she was started on broad spectrum antibiotics. urine output diminished and o2 saturation remained poor despite maximal ventillation settings.  echocardiogram was repeated without acute findings and abdominal ultasouhnd did not show cholecystitis.  family meeting was held.  family expressed that patient would not want to undergo prolonged intubation and that continued invasive measures.  patient remained intubated and on maximal support until all of her family could be at her bedside.  based on recurring family meetings and once all family members were present, patient was made cmo and expired.",782,"[{""start"": 7072,

 74 yo m with history of cardiomyopathy (ef 45%), atrial fibrillation, htn, ckd with icd for h/o arrhythmia presenting after 6 episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation leading to icd firing.  patient was on his way to [**hospital3 4107**] today for a scheduled colonoscopy when he became drowsy, vomited and his icd fired.  it fired a total of 3 times before emergency services arrived.  it fired again in the ambulance, and twice in the ed. . patient reports that over the last several weeks, he has been feeling ""lousy"", reporting fatigue, loss of appetite and weakness.  he saw his pcp who ran several tests and recommended a colonoscopy.  colonoscopy was scheduled for [**7-30**] and patient prepped the night before.  however, he was extremely weak and could not stop having diarrhea and cancelled the colonoscopy. the procedure was re-scheduled for [**10-8**] with plan for patient to be admitted the night before for bowel prep and ?2u blood transfusion.  patient reports that he had not eaten for >24hrs as he was concerned he might ""get the call"" to come in for the colonoscopy. . patient's icd was placed in [**2150**] at [**hospital1 2025**] after he ""flat-lined."" he has only been shocked once, which was approximately 1 week following original icd placement and reports that it was because he ""didn't have enough sotalol."" of note, patient had a generator change of his icd on [**2162-7-14**], and has ""not felt right"" since. . patient reports a 31lb weight loss over the past 4 months which was partly intentional, but he believes he ""went overboard,"" losing more than intended.  he denies chest pain or palpitations recently, but does report shortness of breath.  he denies orthopnea or pnd.  he has noted worsening fluid accumulation in his lower extremities. . per report of the patient, he had a stool guaiac which was positive which prompted the colonoscopy.  however, patient denies any melena or hematochezia.  in addition, he has not noted any changes in the caliber of his stool, and denies abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea.  he denies dysuria or hematuria.  he does report recent nocturia, urgency and occasional overflow incontinence. . in the ed, patient had two episodes of witnessed vtach and was unresponsive and shocked by icd.  12 lead ekg captured override pacing of monomorphic vt decompensating into ventricular fibrillation during the first episode.  the precipitating rhythm was not captured.  during the second event, 12 lead ekg captured a pvc decompensating into vf.  patient was started on a lidocaine drip.  his potassium and magnesium were low and were repleted.  patient was seen by the ep team who increased his pacer settings to a rate of 80 and the patient was admitted to the ccu for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
 74 yo male with cardiomyopathy and h/o arrhythmia with icd presenting with ventricular tachycardia/ fibrillation s/p 6 icd firings. . # s/p vt with icd firing- patient has a history of ischemic vs mixed cardiomyopathy.  patient presented with progressively worsening heart failure over the past several weeks.  during a prep for colonoscopy the patient reported feeling increasingly drowsy and weak with multiple episodes of loose stools. patient's icd was reported to have fired several times in the hours priror to admission.  patient was seen by the ep team who increased his pacer settings to a rate of 80 and initially treated with iv lidocaine and transitioned to oral mexilitine. while no exact etiology was found to explain the patient's icd firing it was felt it may have been due to stress from high output bowel preparation. sotalol and digoxin were stopped and the patient was continued on amiodarone 200 mg daily and mexilitine 150 mg every 8 hours. . # chf- patient has history of known systolic dysfunction with a depressed ef.  echocardiogram performed during this admission showed ef of 30% with regional wall motion abnormalities, right ventricular failure and lv hypertrophy.  patient was significantly volume overloaded at the time of admission and was diuresed.  patient was evaluated for ongoing ischemia with a persantine stress test.  this showed  cardiac chamber enlargement and severe anteroapical and moderate inferoseptal perfusion defects. patient was unable to complete the study as he became acutely aggitated and the study canceled.  patient was later noticed to be hypotensive and fluid responsive raising concern for over diuresis.  lasix was held and patient gradually weaned back on to home antihypertensives. at the time of transfer patient was on metoprolol 6.25 mg. lasix was held and should be restarted at 20 mg and gradually increased to home dose of 40 mg.  lisinopril will also need to be restarted at 5 mg once bps are stable. . # guiac positive stools-  patient reports that he had positive stool guaiac with pcp.  [**name10 (nameis) **] denies melena or hematochezia.  he does have a history of diverticulitis s/p partial colectomy. his hematocrit dropped during this admission to 26 from his baseline around 30. he received 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit bumped appropriately.  his coumadin was initially held in the setting of guaic positive stools. he received an egd and colonoscopy while inpatient which showed gastritis and duodenitis as well as diverticulosis. iron studies were sent as well which showed him to be iron deficient with an iron level of 8. he was repleted with ferric gluconate 125 mg iv daily for severe iron deficiency.  patient was started on pantoprazole 40 mg [**hospital1 **]. h pylori antibody and biopsy stain were pending at the the time of transfer. . # leukocytosis- white count was elevated at the time of admission which was initially felt to reflect the icd firing that precipitated admission.  his counts initially trended down, but early in the hospital course spiked to 23 associated with an acute change in mental status, though the patient was afebrile. a full infectious work up was conducted including negative head, chest, abdomen and pelvis cat scans, multiple negative blood and urine cultures, and a negative wbc scan.  c diff was negative on several occasions.  patient was treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin for a 10 day course for possible hcap (last day [**2162-10-19**]).  patient was also evaluated by the hematology service. a blood smear, lead levels, spep/upep, and imaging were all normal, and no bone marrow biopsy was preformed.  a bcr-abl gene mutation was pending at the time of transfer.  the patient's white cell count was elevated to 18k at the time of transfer.  the exact etiology of his neutrophil predominant leukocytosis is unknown, but can classified without exception as non-infectious in etiology. . # hypotension- the patient experienced several episodes of hypotension which were all fluid responsive. we believe both of these episodes were related to over-diuresis as well as secondary to his blood pressure medications. at the time of discharge he is on metoprolol tartrate 6.25mg twice daily. we are holding the lisinopril, hydralazine, and furosemide. we recommend restarting the furosemide at 20mg daily with gradual uptitration as indicated. the lisinopril and hydralazine can be restarted as tolerated by his blood pressure. . # h/o atrial fibrillation- the patient is on amiodarone and metoprolol as noted above. he is anticoagulated with coumadin. inr has been suptherapeutic and is 1.4 upon discharge. coumadin dose was increased from 2mg to 5mg daily on [**2162-10-26**]. . # diabetes- the patient has a reported recent history of hypoglycemia and is thus not on any diabetes medications. he was monitored via a insulin sliding scale. . # chronic kidney disease- baseline creatinine appears to be ~1.4-1.5 and is 1.3 upon discharge. . # h/o gout- continued on allopurinol. . # transitional issues - pulm nodules 4mm on ct chest - needs f/u in 12 months - bcr-abl test was pending at the time of transfer - h pylori antibody and stain were pending at the time of transfer - patient will need lasix and lisinopril restarted as systolic pressures tolerate.",778,"[{""start"": 2080, ""end"": 2089, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 6087, ""end"": 6094, ""text"": ""abdomen"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 990, ""end"": 995, ""text"": ""bowel"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 3668, ""end"": 3673, ""text"": ""bowel"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1880, ""end"": 1885, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2062, ""end"": 2067, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 3282, ""end"": 3287, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 4842, ""end"": 4847, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 4888, ""end"": 4893, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 5264, ""end"": 5269, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2096, ""end"": 2108, ""text"": ""constipation"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 846, ""end"": 854, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2113, ""end"": 2121, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 616, ""end"": 624, ""text"": ""appetite"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 5336, ""end"": 5345, ""text"": ""gastritis"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 327, ""end"": 332, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 695, ""end"": 700, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 709, ""end"": 714, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 873, ""end"": 878, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1141, ""end"": 1146, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1931, ""end"": 1936, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 3180, ""end"": 3185, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 5295, ""end"": 5300, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2134, ""end"": 2141, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2134, ""end"": 2141, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 7769, ""end"": 7775, ""text"": ""kidney"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 6145, ""end"": 6150, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 4223, ""end"": 4230, ""text"": ""cardiac"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1684, ""end"": 1695, ""text"": ""palpitation"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3118, ""end"": 3123, ""text"": ""heart"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 108, ""end"": 114, ""text"": ""atrial"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 7351, ""end"": 7357, ""text"": ""atrial"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 83, ""end"": 89, ""text"": ""cardio"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2867, ""end"": 2873, ""text"": ""cardio"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3054, ""end"": 3060, ""text"": ""cardio"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3899, ""end"": 3905, ""text"": ""cardio"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2731, ""end"": 2736, ""text"": ""pacer"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3430, ""end"": 3435, ""text"": ""pacer"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 155, ""end"": 165, ""text"": ""arrhythmia"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2890, ""end"": 2900, ""text"": ""arrhythmia"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1670, ""end"": 1675, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 6080, ""end"": 6085, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 7944, ""end"": 7949, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1723, ""end"": 1742, ""text"": ""shortness of breath"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1755, ""end"": 1764, ""text"": ""orthopnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Gastrointestinal"", ""Endocarditis""]}",,4,737,2023-05-23T07:48:33.858918Z,2023-05-23T07:48:33.858948Z,120.286

Brief Hospital Course:
 50 year old female with a history of type 1 dm complicated by esrd s/p renal transplant x 2 ([**2145**], [**2164**]), neurogenic bladder requiring self catheterization and hepatitis c.  she was diagnosed with fungal uti and completed two week course of fluconazole presented with one day of fever and chills. found to have sepsis with k. pneumoniae secondary to ug source . active issues # sepsis: initially treated in icu as pt had some ams and fit sirs criteria with fever, and tachycardia. started on empiric vanc and cefepime. transferred to liver/renal service after vs were stabilized. initially spiked a temperature on the floor, but antibiotic dosing was subtherapeutic prior to arrival. after increasing to proper dose she was afebrile. after initial blood and urine cultures came back positive for k. pneumoniae she was switched to iv ceftriaxone. likely source of infection was from seeding of concomitant pyelonephritis. follow-up blood cultures have been negative and pt was asymptomatic at time of discharge. discharged on 3 week course of oral ciprofloxacin.  . #pyelonephritis: see above. h/o pyelo and recurrent uti's in the past, likely from self-catheterization [**3-3**] neurogenic bladder. ct scan on the floor demonstrated focal pyelonephritis of l. transplant kidney with no drainable fluid collections. at time of discharge foley catheter was removed and pt was urinating without symptoms of infection. switched to po ciprofloxacin to complete a total 3 week course. . # acute kidney injury: creatinine to 1.4 from baseline of 1.1. likely prerenal from above. decreased with iv fluids . chronic issues # renal transplant: patient s/p 2 renal transplants and has had native nephrectomies. she is several years post transplant and maintained on immunosuppresion with tacro and prednisone. she reports taking ca, vit d and bactrim proph. tacro dose increased per nephrology. prednisone dose initially increased while in-hospital, but decreased to home dose at time of discharge. . #

 rle and lue pain and edema

History of Present Illness:
 62 y/o male with h/o crohn's disease on chronic steroids, recently admitted [**7-13**] to [**7-22**] for lle cellulitis and new-onset jaundice thought to be due to recent etoh use, who presented to the ed with increasing edema, rle and lue pain, worsening edema, and dark urine x 1 week.  during his prior admission for jaundice, he had a liver biopsy that showed mild fibrosis, thought to be c/w toxic-metabolic injury from etoh and tylenol. his liver biopsy specifically did not show cirrhosis.  of note, the pt used to drink approx 6 beers/day x 30 yrs, and had stopped 9 years ago.  1 week prior to his admission in [**month (only) 205**], he went on a cruise and began drinking etoh again.  after the [**month (only) 205**] admission, he denies using any more alcohol, as he was specifically instructed not to do so upon discharge.  he notes that he has never felt completely well since his discharge, and he has had worsening rle and lue pain and swelling.  his skin was very fragile, and would break open easily.  in [**month (only) 205**] he had had a lle infection that resolved with a course of unasyn-->augmetin-->keflex.  he also noted worsening shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion (since d/c).  he denies black or bloody stools, abdominal pain, or coffee ground emesis. in the ed, he had a ruq u/s with dopplers that was unchanged from prior, demonstrating normal dopplers with a diffusely echogenic liver.  he had ultrasounds of his 2 painful extremities (rle, lue) which were negative for dvt.  he was sent to the [**hospital unit name 153**] for further management of his cellulitis, as they were concerned that it would evolve to sepsis given his [**last name (un) **] steroid use; as well as for management of his worsening liver fxn (inr 2.8 on adm).

Brief Hospital Course:
 a 74 year-old woman presenting with clear signs of a systemic infection, including fevers, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and elevated lactate. likely source is right leg cellulitis. . 1. infection, cellulitis. at admission, she had significant pain and erythema at the site of the right leg laceration. her systemic symptoms were felt to be due to inflammatory response from the cellulitis. she was admitted to the micu overnight for monitoring given concern of sirs (tachycardia, tachypnea, lactic acidosis), and started empirically on iv vancomycin. the next morning she returned to the medicine floors with stable vitals and resolved acidosis. the area of cellulitis had also decreased substantially in size. she continued to have intermittent episodes of chills, with fevers up to 101, on the vancomycin. blood cultures were repeatedly drawn, and these all returned negative (including cultures taken from the ed). urine cultures were also negative. she underwent transthoracic echo for concern of endocarditis. this showed normal ejection fraction with no valvular vegetations. once therapeutic on the vanco, her fever curve began down-trending, although she continued to have occasional episodes of chills. she underwent right leg mri which showed no evidence of osteomyelitis. she also had lower extremity dopplers that were negative for dvt. liver enzymes were checked for concern of alcalculous cholecystitis; these were mildly elevated but consistent with her baseline transaminitis, likely from nafld. after five days of vancomycin, with no positive culture data, we switched her to oral linezolid to complete a fourteen day course. at time of discharge, she has not had fevers in over 24 hours. her last recorded fever was 100.0. she had a markedly elevated crp (222) during this admission, and it is felt her fevers and chills are due to a prolonged inflammatory response to the cellulitis. symptomatically she feels improved, and her cellulitis is resolving. . 2. hypertension. her atenolol-chlorthalidone was held at admission due to hypotension in the setting of possible sepsis. once stable on the floors, her antihypertensive was restarted without complication. . 3. hypothyroidism. we continued her home levothyroxine. . 4. chronic pain/neuropathy. we continued her home pain regimen, which includes gabapentin, lidocaine patch, tolmetin and cyclobenzaprine prn. . 5. gastrointestinal reflux disease. we continued her home proton pump inhibitor. . 6. chronic bronchitis. we continued her home albuterol. . she was kept on a normal diet. subcutaneous heparin, then pneumoboots, were used for venous thrombosis prophylaxis. her code status is dni, but okay to resuscitate. this was confirmed with patient and daughter during this admission.",769,"[{""start"": 1292, ""end"": 1297, ""text"": "" abd "", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 3712, ""end"": 3718, ""text"": ""gastro"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 3712, ""end"": 3728, ""text"": ""gastrointestinal"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2675, ""end"": 2680, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2804, ""end"": 2817, ""text"": ""transaminitis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2734, ""end"": 2742, ""text"": ""cystitis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2244, ""end"": 2249, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2327, ""end"": 2339, ""text"": ""endocarditis"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 650, ""end"": 657, ""text"": ""erythem"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1578, ""end"": 1585, ""text"": ""erythem"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 540, ""end"": 545, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 2628, ""end"": 2637, ""text"": ""extremity"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 24, ""end"": 27, ""text"": ""leg"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1491, ""end"": 1494, ""text"": ""leg"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1612, ""end"": 1615, ""text"": ""leg"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 2558, ""end"": 2561, ""text"": ""leg"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 28, ""end"": 38, ""text"": ""cellulitis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1495, ""end"": 1505, ""text"": ""cellulitis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1523, ""end"": 1533, ""text"": ""cellulitis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1704, ""end"": 1714, ""text"": ""cellulitis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1984, ""end"": 1994, ""text"": ""cellulitis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3217, ""end"": 3227, ""text"": ""cellulitis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3273, ""end"": 3283, ""text"": ""cellulitis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 953, ""end"": 958, ""text"": ""osteo"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 2594, ""end"": 2599, ""text"": ""osteo"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 540, ""end"": 545, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 3581, ""end"": 3586, ""text"": ""neuro"", ""labels"": [""Neurological""]}, {""start"": 3803, ""end"": 3809, ""text"": ""bronch"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1806, ""end"": 1815, ""text"": ""tachypnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",Skin and soft tissue,None of the above,,4,728,2023-05-23T07:37:51.529192Z,2023-05-23T07:37:51.529228Z,55.081

 dyspnea, cough

History of Present Illness:
 hpi: pt is an 84f with emphysema, cad, cardiomyopathy who presents with 3-4 days subacute dyspnea, mildly productive cough, and low grade fever.  she felt otherwise well until two days prior to admission when she developed cough, worsening sob, and wheezing over the course of the day.  her cough was productive of yellow phlegm.  she uses 2l 02 at home at night, but had to increase it to 3l.  she also admitted to increased fatigue, being unable to ambulate as well with her walker. additionally, she described low grade fever as well but never took her temp.  she denied sinus congestion, cp, nausea/vomitting, abd pain, leg pain or swelling, orthopnea, travel or sick contacts.  at baseline, patient lives alone and is able to carry out adls and ialds.  she denies anginal pain or lightheadedness with exertion.  she denies symptoms of chronic bronchitis but says that she has been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia 3 times in the last six months. . in the ed, t 99.9, hr 96, bp 117/53, rr 26, 92% 3l.  bp ranged from 90-105 systolic, given 2l ns.  hr improved to 80s.  pt given levofloxacin 750mg iv x1 as well as nebulizers.  high lactate eventually normalized after 2l fluids.  ekg unchanged from prior. . on arrival to the floor, pt immediately triggered for bp 82/palp bilat, hr 80s, rr 26.  pt asymtpomatic, denying dizziness, cp, worsened sob or bleeding from anywhere.  brief exam was notable for dry mm, relatively clear lungs with prolonged exp phase, cough.  with 500ml ns, bp improved to 96/40.  labs/ekg redrawn.

Brief Hospital Course:
 # hypoxia/copd exacerbation and mrsa aspiration pna: patient was admitted for worsening sob, fevers, and productive cough. cxr showed an infiltrate at rll. she was started on levaquin for presumed community aquired pneumonia. there was also concern that she may have aspirated given her recent speech and swallow evaluation. based on physical exam and cxr, she did not seem significantly fluid overloaded although her ef is ~40%. she denied any chest pain and cardiac enzymes were negative and her ekg was unchanged so this was unlikely an acute cardiac event. pulmonary embolism was also on the differential but low on the differential since the patient was ambulatory at home and had no other risk factors.  although d-dimer was elevated in the micu, le dopplers were negative for dvt. . she was started on vancomycin for mrsa in sputum in addition to the levaquin she was receiving for empiric treatment of cap. she received albuterol and ipratropium nebs at standing order doses, and was also written for acetylcysteine and guaifenesin. during the hospital course, her oxygen requirements increased and she was transferred to the micu briefly for bipap.  at time of transfer back to the floors, she was satting in mid 90s on 6l nasal cannula.  she was gradually weaned off of 02 until time of discharge, at which time her o2 sats were stable on 3l nc o2 with sats of 92-94%. given her history of emphysema, the goal for her would be to keep her o2 sat between 90-92%, and not higher as she would be at risk for co2 retaining. her home baseline nc o2 prior to hospitalization was 2l nc o2 at night. . during her time in the micu, patient was started on iv solumedrol for treatment of possible copd exacerbation.  it was also during this time that her abx regimen was broadened to include vancomycin in addition to levoquin.  she finished her 7 day course of vancomycin/levaquin by discharge and was discharged on a slow prednisone taper of 8 days duration.  the patient should recieve: 40mg x 2 days 30mg x 2 days 20mg x 2 days 10mg x 2 days. . # oral thrush: the patient reported a slight sore throat and had some evidence of oral [**female first name (un) **], she was started on lidocaine and nystatin swish and spit. the nystatin can be discontinued in [**4-8**] days or as symptoms resolve. . # blood pressure control: on admission, patient was hypotensive with sbp 100s. her bp improved with ivf boluses. baseline bp per omr records is 120-130s/80. she likely had early sepsis physiology and met sirs criteria on admission. she never required pressors during time in the micu.  at time of transfer back to floors her sbp is 100-120s with hypotension resolved.  her antihypertensives were held in the icu but as her bp normalized, she was restarted on lisinopril which was slowly titrated up to 10mg po daily at discharge. . # af with rvr: while in the micu, patient had brief period of atrial fibrillation that resolved with electrical cardioversion and digoxin loading. the likely cause was critical illness, unlikely to be permanent (paf) but her echo was repeated showing systolic ventricular function of 40%. the patient was started on digoxin after a load to improve her cardiac function. she would also likely benefit from anticoagulation treatment with coumadin, which the patient is amenable to. the patient was started on coumadin 5mg po daily and should be continued on this with inr monitoring with follow up with an [**hospital3 **]/pcp for coumadin adjusting. . # cad: continued home asa. . # depression: continued home celexa, . # hyperlipidemia: continued simvastatin at home dose. . # access: midline was placed in the micu.  picc was placed when placed for anticipated iv antibiotics. however, as patient finished her antibiotic course in the hospital, picc line was discontinued at discharge. . #. code status: the patient was initially admitted with wishes to be dnr/dni per discussion on the floor with the patient. after the patient had her episode of respiratory distress leading to transfer to the icu, a family discussion was held including the patient and her sons, which led to her code status to be reversed to full code. the patient was never intubated in the icu. after transfer back to the floor, code status and goals of care were readdressed and the patient wishes to continue as full code at this time. full code.",768,"[{""start"": 676, ""end"": 681, ""text"": "" abd "", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 1929, ""end"": 1936, ""text"": ""swallow"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 378, ""end"": 384, ""text"": ""yellow"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 5407, ""end"": 5413, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 5275, ""end"": 5279, ""text"": ""picc"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 5403, ""end"": 5407, ""text"": ""picc"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 2084, ""end"": 2091, ""text"": ""cardiac"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2170, ""end"": 2177, ""text"": ""cardiac"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 4809, ""end"": 4816, ""text"": ""cardiac"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 4519, ""end"": 4525, ""text"": ""atrial"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 102, ""end"": 108, ""text"": ""cardio"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 4569, ""end"": 4575, ""text"": ""cardio"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2069, ""end"": 2074, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 699, ""end"": 707, ""text"": ""swelling"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 387, ""end"": 390, ""text"": ""leg"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 687, ""end"": 690, ""text"": ""leg"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 5606, ""end"": 5617, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 979, ""end"": 988, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1839, ""end"": 1848, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 86, ""end"": 95, ""text"": ""emphysema"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3024, ""end"": 3033, ""text"": ""emphysema"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 911, ""end"": 917, ""text"": ""bronch"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3722, ""end"": 3728, ""text"": ""throat"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2185, ""end"": 2194, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 27, ""end"": 32, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 180, ""end"": 185, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 286, ""end"": 291, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 354, ""end"": 359, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1535, ""end"": 1540, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1740, ""end"": 1745, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1672, ""end"": 1675, ""text"": ""pna"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1634, ""end"": 1638, ""text"": ""copd"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3320, ""end"": 3324, ""text"": ""copd"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1503, ""end"": 1507, ""text"": ""lung"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 5804, ""end"": 5812, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 709, ""end"": 718, ""text"": ""orthopnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 18, ""end"": 25, ""text"": ""dyspnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 153, ""end"": 160, ""text"": ""dyspnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1661, ""end"": 1671, ""text"": ""aspiration"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1418, ""end"": 1423, ""text"": "" sob "", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Endocarditis"", ""Respiratory""]}",,4,727,2023-05-23T07:36:54.818430Z,2023-05-23T07:36:54.818460Z,59.77

 59 y/o m with pmhx of esrd, cad s/p mi, cmp, seizure disorder and cva who fell in his apt on sunday, two days prior to presentation, and was reportedly found down by his landlord 48 hours later. patient reports he had not eaten for 36 hours for unclear reasons, and went to the bathroom and felt weak as he got up to flush the toilet. pt reports collapsing to the floor due to weakness, hit his head, and was unable to get up because he felt profoundly weak. denies loc, aura, alteration of mental status, vision changes, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath but reported several days of productive cough with minimal white/yellow sputum. he reports the day prior to his fall, he had eaten only breakfast and had 3-4 episodes of non-bloody nausea and vomiting that night, which he attributes to the food he ate that morning. per report, pt pulled himself to his bedroom and laid there for two days until found. however, pt is now denying moving himself to his bedroom. . in the ed, initial vitals were t99.2 , bp 113/62, r 20, unable to get an o2 saturation anywhere. pt was placed on 4l nc and had an abg with pao2 123. pt was found to be hypoglycemic on arrival, and received 2 amps of glucose. pt was complaining of total body pain, but denied chest pain or abdominal pain. he was placed in a c-collar due to total body pain. ekg showed nsr with first degree block, lbbb with [**street address(2) **] depressions. patient was admitted to the floor in anticipation of dialysis and for further workup and management. . today, pt was notably tachycardic and hypotensive. he was given boluses ivf and bp improved. blood cultures returned positive for gpcs and ct revealed multiple lung abscesses. pt was transferred to the icu given concern for sepsis with leukocytosis, hypotension, +bld cultures and abscesses. on transfer to the [**name (ni) **] pt still endorses general malaise and full body pain. . review of systems: (-) denies any cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations. .

Brief Hospital Course:
 assessment and plan: this is a 59 y.o. male with hd dependent esrd, cad s/p mi, non-ischemic cmy ef 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. pt transferred from the floor for mssa sepsis. . #. sepsis: given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with blood cultures growing mssa. pt also found to have multiple pulmonary abscesses and grew mssa out of multiple bal specimens. pt also grew mssa from tunneled hd catheter tip which was pulled on [**8-26**]. suspect source to be tunnelled catheter line, perhaps seeding of heart valves (though tte did not show vegetations). pt was initially treated with vancomycin and then transitioned to nafcillin when sensitivities returned. pt also completed a course of broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for aspiration pneumonia. no abscesses noted in spleen or liver. no brain abscesses seen on head ct. pt had lp while on abx which was negative and also had mri of entire spine (no contrast) to look for epidural abscess, and no lesions compressing cord were identified. temporary hd catheter was placed on [**8-26**]. pt continued to spike occasional fevers from [**8-26**] through [**9-5**], despite negative blood cultures. this was felt to perhaps be [**1-25**] lung abscesses, however, the possibility of seeding of the temp catheter placed [**8-26**] was also considered. temp catheter was pulled on [**9-5**] and new temporary line was placed. culture of this catheter tip has also been negative to date. ct chest on [**9-9**] showed improvement in pulmonary abscesses. repeat tte and ct head were unchanged and showed no new vegetations/emboli. he remained persistently febrile, likely [**1-25**] fact that pulmonary abscesses not yet sterile. id recommend switch to cefazolin with hd. last day of abx should be [**2117-10-6**]. please see directions re: weekly lab tests and abx monitoring in page 1. . # respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure, but had copious purulent secretions and altered mental status so vent was weaned slowly and eventually discontinued on [**2117-9-3**]. he was saturating at 97-100% on 2l nc on discharge. . #. back pain: pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and specifically back pain. in the [**name (ni) **] pt was placed on a c-spine given his pain and underwent a c/t/l spine ct with contrast which showed no gross abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses. pt remained in c collar because unable to clear c-spine for 9 days. upon extubation pt was able to follow commands and denied pain over his spine. cspine cleared and collar removed. pt recieved fentanyl boluses initially for pain control, switched to drip when intubated and then transitioned to a fentanyl patch on extubation. . #anemia ?????? pt with chronic anemia in setting of crf on hd. pt was occasionally transfused (transfusion goal >21). pt was started on epo 5000 3x weekly. hct on discharge 21. he should have 1 unit prbc with next hd session. . #hypotension: likely secondary to persistent infection and lung abscesses. initially requiring pressors, but able to wean pressors along with weaning sedation. generally seemed to be fluid responsive. he tolerated pressures to 80's and 90's systolic with no change in lactate or mental status. he likely has a low baseline in light of his other comorbidities. . ##. esrd: pt currently hd dependent, was on cvvh, now on hd ?????? 2 liters negative yesterday. pt was initially continued on both phoslo and sevelamer. pt continued hd initially and then transitioned to cvvh [**1-25**] hypotension. pt was able to restart hd on [**9-5**]. sevelamer was discontinued as pt became hypophosphatemic while on hd. . #? ileus: feculent material from ngt on [**9-1**]. kub and ct abd/pelvis were reassuring as did not indicate ileus or sbo. surgery evaluated pt as well. this resolved without intervention and pt was able to tolerate tube feeds by [**9-2**]. . ##. non-ichemic cmy: pt's prior echo in [**2114**] shows ef of 35-40% as well as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to mid septal, anterior and inferior segments, repeat tte was similar. pt was continued on home digoxin. . ##. seizure d.o.: pt did have one grand mal seizure in setting of hd and not on oxcarbezepine ([**1-25**] no ngt at that time). ngt was placed and pt resumed home regimen of levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine. per neuro pt should cont on *keppra 500mg [**hospital1 **] with an extra dose on hd days and *oxcarbamazepine 300mg tid, extra dose on hd days. also pt started on neurontin 300mg [**hospital1 **]. . # elevated inr: inr of 1.4- has been stable, likely [**1-25**] npo and abx. . # ppi: pt started on ppi [**hospital1 **] while intubated. have reduced this to pantoprazole 40mg daily. would suggest stopping this medication if patient has no symptoms of reflux. . # ? renal mass: per ct read: ""right renal high denity region (2, 30) in a setting of end-stage renal disease, likely represents a hyperdense cyst, although underlying tumor cannot be ruled out"" pt should have re-imaging as outpt and urology follow up.",764,"[{""start"": 1323, ""end"": 1332,

 hypotension, pea/vf arrest

History of Present Illness:
 hpi: 67m with h/o htn, hyperlipidemia, and depression presented to an osh on [**9-16**] after being found unresponsive at home.  he complained of 1 week of weakness, fatigue, and increased abdominal pain prior to presentation.  on the am of [**9-16**], he was found unresponsive by his wife.  ems found him to be bradycardic without a pulse, and received epinephrine/atropine and was intubated in the field.  at the osh, ecg showed inferior ste and he was flown to [**hospital1 18**] for cath.  his cath showed clean coronaries.  he had vf arrest in the cath lab and was shocked into nsr.  cxr showed large r pleural effusion with ? mediastinal shift, so ct surgery placed a chest tube, which drained >1l mucinous fluid.  he was started on levophed and vasopressin for sbp 70s.  lvgram showed .  hemodynamics showed co 4.12, ci 1.93, elevated r and l-sided filling pressures (ra 14, pcwp 25).  he was admitted to the ccu for further management. . in the ccu, his vs on arrival were t 97.8, hr 75, bp 98/30 on levophed and vasopressin, o2sat 98% on ac 700x12/0/100%. cultures were sent including pleural fluid.  ct head showed sah, neurosurgery was consulted, recommended mri/a when stable.  ct torso was performed to look for infectious source.  ng with clots, transfused 1u prbc, started on protonix gtt.

Brief Hospital Course:
 # shock: pt had septic physiology on admission to the ccu, and the most likely source was felt to be postobstructive pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion. his ci was high, so his hypotension was not felt to be due to cardiogenic shock. he was initially maintained on 3 pressors upon transfer to the micu service, but neosynephrine was weaned off quickly. he was given empiric zosyn and vancomycin to cover polymicrobial sepsis. levophed was gradually weaned the next day, and then vasopressin was stopped. levophed had to be restarted for a few hours on [**9-19**] for map<60, but it was weaned off the next day. . # respiratory failure: pt was intubated during his first pea arrest. the r-sided chest tube initially drained a large volume of mucinous fluid, then drained serosanguinous fluid. the fluid was grossly exudative with ldh 4000 on a diluted specimen. the pleural fluid amylase was also elevated, to 3x the serum value. the gram stain was negative, and cultures are no growth to date. his noncontrast chest ct showed a rll rounded opacity with no air bronchograms but density consistent with lung parenchyma. the differential was thought to include atelectasis vs. postobstructive pneumonia vs. sequestration. he underwent a bronchoscopy on [**9-18**] with mild secretions and no endobronchial lesions visualized, and a bal was sent. his ventilatory requirements were gradually weaned, however he had trouble ventilating adequately while on pressure support. ct chest with contrast showed the rll opacity was a large mass with significant surrounding lymphadenopathy and marked pleural tumor, with possible invasion into the chest wall. pleural fluid cytology returned suspicious for adenocarcinoma, and pt was ultimately diagnosed with stage iiia lung cancer.  pt's progressive respiratory failure was treated with bipap and nebs, but he continually removed his bipap, leading to significantly labored breathing and desaturation.  a family meeting concluded that bipap should be deferred, and that pt should be made dnr/dni with a focus on full comfort measures.  pt ultimately died of respiratory failure likely due to a combination of copd, pneumonia and lung cancer on the morning of [**2191-10-3**]. . # altered mental status: she had a subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage on ct. neurosurgery was consulted, and felt that the bleed was likely an effect of reperfusion during arrest. he had leukocytosis but no fever, and no history of headache at home, so meningitis was thought to be unlikely and lp was deferred. tox screen was negative on admission. he was able to follow commands and communicate effectively when his sedation was weaned.  pt maintained a waxing-[**doctor last name 688**] course until his death on [**2191-10-3**]. . # arf: it was thought likely secondary to hypoperfusion/atn in the setting of cardiac arrest and shock. his creatinine gradually improved to normal. . # ugib: his og tube initially drained clots on admission. he was felt to have an upper gi bleed in the setting of heparin and integrilin in the cath lab, and it was self-resolved. upon transfer to the micu, his og tube was draining a thick white chylous-appearing fluid. that also resolved spontaneously. his ct was reviewed by radiology who stated there was no evidence of esophageal perforation. he was maintained on an iv ppi [**hospital1 **], and his hct remained stable for the remainder of his course. . pt was maintained on full comfort measures once a family meeting concluded that he sould be made dnr/dni w/o further aggressive management of his progressive respiratory failure.  on the morning of [**2191-10-3**], pt died a peaceful death due to complications of progressive respiratory failure, likely secondary to lung cancer, pneumonia, copd and an expanding malignant pleural effusion.  pt's family was notified, and they deferred autopsy.",763,"[{""start"": 264, ""end"": 273, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"":

History of Present Illness:
 the patient is a 75-year-old female who complains of progressively worsening rectal and buttock pain over the past 2 weeks. upon presenting to the [**hospital1 18**] ed today, she initially had a hr of 77 with a bp of 105/69, but quickly became hypotensive to 56/40 with a heart rate of 98. sepsis protocol was initiated. a central line was placed with great difficulty due to near-complete ivc collapse. she was placed on a norepinephrine drip and underwent a ct scan when she was somewhat stable. the scan shows a large pre-sarcal abscess with rim enhancement, and air and fat stranding tracking to a r hip prosthesis.

Brief Hospital Course:
 patient admitted to sicu.  started on antibiotics, resuscitated with fluids, intubated, and placed on pressors.  she quickly deteriorated and had worsening acidosis with a ph as low as 6.9 and lactate greater than 20.  she was requiring multiple pressors and her due to her age and prognosis, it was decided to speak with the family regarding comfort measures, as there was no effective long term treatment for the pelvic source of sepsis.  the family agreed.  it took about 24 hours to get all the family members to the hospital to say their goodbyes.  once they arrived the ett was removed, pressors and ivfs were stopped.  the patient continued to breath spontaneous and maintain a blood pressure in the low 80s.  after many hours it appeared that the dying process may take a while longer. therefore she was transferred to the floor and treated with an infusion of morphine for pain control. on [**2117-2-10**] at 0405 am the patient expired, immedicate cause of death being cardiopulmonary failure secondary to sepsis. the family was present at the time of death, and declined an autopsy. the attending physician of record, dr.

Brief Hospital Course:
 assessment and plan:  patient is a 66 yo male with h/o pvd, dm ii, systolic chf, recent admissions for le heel ulcers and osteomyelitis, who was admitted to the micu with fever to 103 and ?altered mental status. . #. mrsa bacteremia/septicemia: patient was found to have mrsa bacteremia and was started on vancomycin iv.  it is thought that the patient's heel ulcers are the most likely source, and xray of the patients heel showed evidence of possible osteomyelitis. other sources of bacteremia could possibly be endocarditis, empyema, spinal abscess, gastroenteritis.  the patient had a tte and a tee, which did not show any evidence of vegetations, and he has defervesced and clinically improved on iv vancomycin.  id was consulted, and they noticed a loculated pocket around his heel ulcer, which they sent for culture.  this wound culture grew out mrsa on [**2142-11-15**]. there were negative bcx on [**11-13**] and ngtd from [**11-15**], suggesting that the heel is the likely site for bacteremia. podiatry and vascular had been consulted, and they did not indicate a need for amputation at this time. both services were re-consulted for recs after new micro data. vascular reiteriated that no operative management was needed at this time and felt that the wounds are healing well and no pus could be expressed when examined. ortho was consulted about the need for possible biopsy of his hip for osteomyleitis given findings on hip xray. ortho attending saw pt and reviewed ct and determined that no surgical or diagnostic procedures were needed at this time.  while the initial hip films showed multiple lucencies in the right proximal femur that might be osteomyleitis, the ct read suggested that the findings were more consistent with degenerative disease. given the plain film findings of possible new [**last name (un) 2043**] changes in his left heel, id recommended treating for osteomyelitis for 6wks with iv vancomycin. a picc line was placed on the day of discharge. pt was initially on q48hr dosing of his vancomycin given his poor renal function. id and renal both recommened changing the dosing to q24 given improved renal function (see below), but a vanc trough taken 4 hours before his last dose was 20.6 and a midpoint taken 24hrs later was 26.4. these levels were considered appropriate and his vanc dosing was left at q 48h. his renal function should be follwed carefully and his vanc trough checked weekly. . #. acute on chronic renal insufficiency:  patient's cr on admission was 3.9, which is increased from his baseline of 3. during this hospitalization, the patient also developed oliguria, which was thought to be secondary to dehydraton in the setting of sepsis.  the patient's urine electrolytes are consistent with a prerenal etiology, yet his cr continued to increase in the setting of fluid resuscitation to a peak of 4.7 on [**2142-11-16**].  it's now thought that the acute renal failure was secondary to atn in the setting of sepsis. his cr has been improving for the last several days, decreasing from a peak of 4.7 to 3.2, to 2.7, down to 2.4 on day of discharge. renal felt that pt had reached his baseline. given his improving renal function renal recommending increasing vancomycin dosing. see above. . #. heel ulcers/pvd:  the patient has bilateral heel ulcers and a h/o osteomyelitis on his l leg.  vascular surgery was consulted during this admission, and they recommended leg elevation and ace bandages.  podiatry was also consulted, and wound care followed the patient. vascular surgery felt that the heel ulcers were healing well and that the patient should continue iv antibiotics. . #. delirium:  the patient was delirious on admission.  this resolved with antibiotic treatment of bacteremia. it was thought that his change in mental status may be secondary to either hypoxia in the setting of fluid overload and pulmonary edema or metabolic abnormalities in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. . #. cad s/p cabg:  the patient had a repeat echo on this admission, which demonstrated that his lvef is preserved.  he had a tee, which demonstrated that his right heart is more hypokinetic than previously thought, but showed no evidence of any vegetations or endocarditis. . #constipation - patient has not been having regular bowel movements however no evidence of bowel obstruction with soft non tender abdomen.  he was continued on a bowel regimen which may need to be increased if no response. . # infectious disease follow: please check weekly cbc +diff, bun/cr, vanc trough, goal of 15-20 for troughs. x6 weeks. can follow up with dr.

  the patient is a 72-year-old white male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus who in the last two weeks has undergone two endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for biliary obstruction secondary to choledocholithiasis. approximately two weeks earlier the patient had experienced nausea and vomiting, was seen at [**hospital 882**] hospital. he underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with biliary stone extraction and sphincterotomy on [**2197-3-2**]. he was discharged home after the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography however, he returned to the hospital with nausea and vomiting and jaundice with new onset ascites. his t bili was elevated. he was transferred to [**hospital1 346**] for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which he underwent on [**2197-3-10**], this endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography noted diffusely edematous duodenal wall and major papilla with tapering of the distal cvd and intrahepatic ductal dilatation. findings raised concern for a small bowel microperforation. the patient was transferred back to [**hospital **] hospital where he was treated with antibiotics and discharged home on levaquin. however, the patient continued to experience recurrent fever with nausea and abdominal pain and presented to [**hospital1 69**] on [**2197-3-17**].

Brief Hospital Course:
  as above the patient presented to [**hospital1 69**] with complaints of fever with chills, nausea and abdominal pain. the vital signs obtained revealed the patient to be extremely febrile with hypotension and with a distended diffusely tender abdomen. the patient was admitted to the medical service with the diagnosis of sepsis secondary to recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography instrumentation. he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation was initiated and he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit service. the patient was started on intravenous antibiotics and fluid resuscitation. the patient remained stable in intensive care unit. the surgical team was consulted on [**2197-3-17**] and a paracentesis of the patient's ascitic peritoneal fluid was obtained, cultures were sent for specimen. a ct of the patient's abdomen and pelvis revealed diffuse pancreatitis with ascites. the patient continued to remainclinically stable. his fever defervesced, his blood pressue normalized with systolic pressures consistently in the 120's. he was transferred out of the unit on [**3-18**] to the floor. he did well overnight of [**3-18**] on the floor with the nasogastric tube still in place to wall suction. on the morning of [**3-19**] with the patient afebrile, in no pain, mentating well and requesting to have his nasogastric tube removed. the nasogastric tube was removed, the patient seemed to tolerate this well. however, in the afternoon of [**2197-3-19**] the patient after consuming some liquids the patient complained of increasing abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. it was noted that he became hypotensive with systolic pressures into the 70's, fluid resuscitation was initiated by the medical service and the patient's pressure only responded transiently. he was transferred to the unit to initiate more aggressive resuscitative efforts and a repeat ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis.  ongoing surgical consultation service saw the patient in the intensive careunit it was felt that the patient on examination showed signs of altered mental status, he complained of severe abdominal pain. on examination he was noted to have rebound with involuntary guarding and peritonitis. the ct scan revealed air throughout the pancreas raising the suspicion for necrosis of the patient's pancreas. he was quickly taken to the operating room after consent was obtained, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and necrotic infected pancreatitis was found and debridement was initiated.  during this exploration of the patient's abdomen it was noted that he had widespread necrosis of his pancreas and he became markedly unstable during the latter portions of the procedure.  after resuscitative efforts were initiated, in combination with the surgical and anesthesia team a acls protocol was initiated, resuscitative efforts continued for for 3-4 hours before the patient's condition became unsalvageable and he died.",737,"[{""start"": 29, ""end"": 38, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 1355, ""end"": 1364, ""text"": ""abdominal"",

History of Present Illness:
 70yo m with h/[**initials (namepattern4) **] [**last name (namepattern4) **]-vesicular fistula s/p hemicolectomy complicated by wound dehiscence admitted to osh with ams and arf and transferred tonight to [**hospital1 18**] per family's request. his osh course over the last few months has been collected through the osh records and is as follows: in [**month (only) 956**] he had a [**last name (un) **]-vesicular fistula which was treated with hemicolectomy. he was discharged but came back [**2140-3-7**] with wound dehiscence which was repaired on [**2140-3-7**]. then he was readmitted on [**2140-3-19**] with respiratory distress and was treated with copd flare/acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. he was then transferred to the floor where he evolved arf (thought [**2-2**] prerenal) and got ivf which allowed his creatinine to improve to baseline(from 3). he was then receiving indomethacin, lisinopril, hctz and over the next few days he was then having slow elevation of his creatinine with decreasing uop accompanied by abdominal discomfort and watery, non-bloody diarrhea (although dtr reports only one episode of diarrhea). because of hypotension with bp 80s/60s he was transferred back to the ccu. there he was hypotensive (bp 80s-90s/50s) with low urine output and no response to multiple ivf boluses. he underwent cvl placement and then, because of abdominal distension on exam he underwent ct scan showed no free air but dilated large and small bowel (not surgical) and looked like ileus. he was started on iv flagyl empirically for c diff. the toxin is pending. creatinine now back up to 4.5. k 5.5. at 4pm he was started empirically on vanc iv, zosyn iv, levoquin iv. at this point family requested transfer [**hospital1 18**]. . on the floor, patient was complaining of feeling uncomfortable and thirsty. his daughter reports that his ms is not at baseline however much improved from prior. he is still hallucinating, however, thinking rabbits are in the room, etc. she also notes he is complaining of pain and that the percocet they gave him at the osh were helping.

Brief Hospital Course:
 70yo m with severe copd, recent abdominal surgery c/by wound dehiscence admitted with likely cdiff colitis and arf. . # c diff colitis: patient was started on po vancomycin and iv flagyl.  abdomen was grossly distended, with a bladder pressure of 40.  general surgery was consulted for concern for toxic megacolon, and did not recommend surgical intervention.  he became intermittently hypotensive responsive to fluid boluses. his leukocytosis increased to 44.  on discussion with the family it was decided that the patient would be made comfort measures only, and supportive care would be withdrawn.  he was treated with morphine iv drip for comfort and passed away several hours later. . # acute renal failure/anuria. patient's creatinine at baseline per osh was noted to be 1.2 [**last name (un) **] now 5.0. it was thought that this most likely represented atn from hypotension, secondary to septic shock, possibly complicated by nephrotoxic medications (hctz/lisinopril/indomethacin), or possibllt from post renal obstruction from abdominal compartment syndrome (initial bladder pressure was 40). urology consulted regarding anuria, and believed it was likely fluid retention due to bladder spasm. renal was consulted regarding the need for emergent dialysis. on discussion with the family it was decided that the patient would be made comfort measures only, and supportive care would be withdrawn. . # anion gap metabolic acidosis: likely from sepsis/lactic acidosis vs uremia.  serum electrolytes were followed throughout this hospitalization. . # abdominal wound: per surgical consult from osh there is no need for further surgery, however, wound may be site of infection based on exam and patient with considerable pain.  on discussion with family regarding goals of care, he was treated for pain with morphine gtt. . # copd exacerbation: patient was initially treated with steroids and nebulizer treatements, but these were stopped with change in code status. . # anemia: unclear if patient received a blood transfusion at osh but hct increased over the last 4 days by ten points so this is likely.  hematocrit was monitored.",735,"[{""start"": 1104, ""end"": 1113, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 1438, ""end"": 1447, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 2218, ""end"": 2227, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 3222, ""end"": 3231, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 3741, ""end"": 3750, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 2375, ""end"": 2382, ""text"": ""abdomen"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 1535, ""end"": 1540, ""text"": ""bowel"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1572, ""end"": 1577, ""text"": ""ileus"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1148, ""end"": 1156, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1199, ""end"": 1207, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2285, ""end"": 2292, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2313, ""end"": 2320, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2494, ""end"": 2499, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1572, ""end"": 1577, ""text"": ""ileus"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2413, ""end"": 2420, ""text"": ""bladder"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3262, ""end"": 3269, ""text"": ""bladder"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3374, ""end"": 3381, ""text"": ""bladder"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3287, ""end"": 3295, ""text"": "" urology"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2413, ""end"": 2420, ""text"": ""bladder"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3262, ""end"": 3269, ""text"": ""bladder"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3374, ""end"": 3381, ""text"": ""bladder"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2285, ""end"": 2292, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2313, ""end"": 2320, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2883, ""end"": 2890, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3198, ""end"": 3205, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3388, ""end"": 3395, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 232, ""end"": 237, ""text"": "" arf "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 830, ""end"": 835, ""text"": "" arf "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3047, ""end"": 3050, ""text"": ""atn"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1336, ""end"": 1341, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 187, ""end"": 192, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 572, ""end"": 577, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 2241, ""end"": 2246, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3751, ""end"": 3756, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3835, ""end"": 3840, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3835, ""end"": 3840, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 187, ""end"": 192, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 572, ""end"": 577, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 2241, ""end"": 2246, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 3751, ""end"": 3756, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 674, ""end"": 685, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 756, ""end"": 767, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 716, ""end"": 720, ""text"": ""copd"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2205, ""end"": 2209, ""text"": ""copd"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 4015, ""end"": 4019, ""text"": ""copd"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,Skin and soft tissue,,4,694,2023-05-23T06:54:49.527478Z,2023-05-23T06:54:49.527516Z,7.554

  respiratory distress.

History of Present Illness:
  this is a 67 year-old gentleman with a history of heavy smoking, noninsulin dependent diabetes, recently diagnosed large cell lung cancer transferred from omed service to the [**hospital unit name 153**] for worsening of respiratory distress.  he was initially admitted to the hospital on [**7-15**] to the omed service status post right neck wedge biopsy, which revealed large cell lung cancer.  he did spike a fever to 101 on [**7-17**], but the chest x-ray was unremarkable and culture was also negative.  he was thought to have aspiration events in the setting of over sedation. he received a dose of chemo with carboplatin and paxil on [**7-21**].  he tolerated the chemo well, but started to have desaturation episodes with increased o2 requirements.  his chest x-ray showed increased bilateral basilar infiltrates with left greater then right.  his white count also trended upwards with increased bandemia up to 29%.  he was then started on levofloxacin and flagyl for possible aspiration pneumonia on [**7-22**].  he remained in npo in the past two to three days given concern for aspiration.  he was transferred to the [**hospital unit name 153**] on [**7-23**] for worsening of hypoxia and impending respiratory failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
  the patient was intubated on the day of transfer to the micu.  he was started on broad antibiotic coverage for sepsis.  he remained hypotensive and tachycardic for which he was started on multiple pressors.  however, despite aggressive measures the patient continued to deteriorate clinically.  after a long discussion with the family and dr.

maintain map goal > 60. on exam, pt. warm, so distributive [**name (ni) **] is likely. possible that pt. has adrenal insufficiency. also possible that pt. is becoming septic - increasing wbc, but afebrile. patient was transferred to the micu with a presumed diagnosis of sepsis on [**2109-6-6**].  patient was first bolused to maintain bp (as pt. is losing fluid from multiple places, including continues oozing of liters of serosang fluid from multiple places).  due to the patient's body habitus, it was extremely difficult to obtain accurate bp measurements, especially once the patient's a-line stopped functioning correctly.  on [**2109-6-8**], patient suddenly dropped her blood pressure into the systolic of 70s, with worsening of already poor mental status. patient was dnr/dni per family, so no repeated attempts at intubation were made.  no cpr was performed.  the patient's blood pressure continued to drift down despite use of pressors.   multiple attempts at central line placement by both micu and anesthesia staff placement were attempted, however failed due to the patient's body habitus. the patient's o2 sats drifted below 70% despite max o2 support (aside from intubation). the patient lost all brainstem reflexes.  at that point, family was called, the patient was made cmo, placed on morphine for comfort and expired shortly thereafter. . # leg excision site wound infection: pt. s/p washout/debridement in or yesterday w/ no overt wound infection. pt. afebrile, but w/ increased white count. vac in place, ortho was following the wound. . # confusion:  likely due to sepsis/hypoxic encephalopathy sustained during surgery.  overuse of pain medications on the surgery service might have also contributed.  pain meds were minimized, and infectious workup was in process.  since patient also developed renal failure, uremia was contributing to patient's mental status changes.",723,"[{""start"": 3714, ""end"": 3721, ""text"": ""ascites"", ""labels"":

History of Present Illness:
 58 year old woman with cryptogenic cirrhosis, followed by dr [**first name8 (namepattern2) 2943**] [**name (stitle) 696**], admitted on [**10-1**] with lower gi bleeding, fever and hypotension. micu course was complicated by intubation from [**10-2**] to [**10-16**], bouts of hypotension and oliguria in the setting of profuse bleeding requiring a total of 7u prbc and 16u ffp. source of bleeding was identified as 1) rectal varices and 2) vaginal bleeding, felt to be in setting of flexiseal and very elevated inr. . patient has undergone extensive workup for liver transplantation, given her very elevated meld score (32 today). patient is being transferred to our service for further treatment of liver decompensation and transplant evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
 floor course: #. cirrhosis/transplant eval: the patient's meld was consistently in the high 30's, including total bilirubin levels in the high 30's. alt/ast/ap were generally stable. the etiology of cirrhosis was not entirely clear, as her past workup included a mildly positive anti-smooth muscle antibody, and an isolated positive hbcab, in the absence of surface antigen positivity. repeat anti-[**last name (un) 15412**] was weakly positive at 1:40. igg levels were elevated at >[**2116**]. she was empirically started on prednisone and broad-spectrum antibiotics, to cover possible autoimmune hepatitis as well as low-grade undetected infection. prednisone was subsequently stopped several days later, as the patient had not demonstrated any improvement in her lft's, and she experienced small amounts of blood in her stool. culture data was generally negative, except for urine cultures revealing yeast. pre-transplant evaluation included an endometrial biopsy and pap smear that was negative for malignancy. on [**11-2**], a donor liver was believed to be available, and the patient was taken to the pre-operative holding area. the donor was found to have a soft tissue infection, however, and the surgery was cancelled. the patient remained on the medical floor for several more days, during which her meld increased into the 40's, with persistently high bilirubin, and worsening inr/creatinine. her temperature slowly decreased into the 95-96 range. she did not tolerate a bear hugger. her abx coverage was expanded to vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and micafungin. she became oliguric, and she received high amounts of crystalloid and colloid. on [**11-7**], she was found to have blood in her oropharynx. ent was consulted, and performed rhinoscopy, showing likely epistaxis. she was transferred to the micu, but did not require upper endoscopy. . #. hypervolemia: the patient was massively volume overloaded upon transfer to the floor, given her aggressive iv fluid repletion. she was started on furosemide and spironolactone, and the spironolactone was subsequently increased to 200 mg daily. this was continued until [**11-2**], when the patient's creatinine was first noted to rise. she also developed hyperkalemia and hypermagnesemia, which were attributed to her acute kidney injury. her weights were not recorded on the floor, despite repeated requests to nursing to measure any weights, including bed weights. her recorded i/os were initially consistent with net negative fluid balances, but the patient's urine output progressively worsened. . # leukocytosis: the patient developed a leukocytosis up to 16 in the setting of prednisone therapy. as mentioned above, her culture data was negative and she was consistently afebrile. she had been on broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to this leukocytosis. her temperature and blood pressure slowly trended down, and her antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and micafungin. culture data remained unrevealing, other than consistently growing yeast in her urine. fungal blood and urine cultures were sent, revealing no growth. . # odynophagia/neck pain: the patient complained of a sore throat in the setting of having had an ng tube in place. she was written for magic mouthwash, but did not require it once the ng tube was removed. the medication was discontinued after she was found to be hypermagnesemic, given magnesium component to maalox. she also complained of pain over her left neck, where her central line had been placed. cta of the neck revealed no thrombosis, abscess or fluid collection, and there was no fluctuance to exam.",685,"[{""start"": 1686, ""end"": 1691, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 651, ""end"": 656, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 790, ""end"": 795, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 1901, ""end"": 1906, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 977, ""end"": 981, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2226, ""end"": 2230, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 124, ""end"": 133, ""text"": ""cirrhosis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 880, ""end"": 889, ""text"": ""cirrhosis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 1062, ""end"": 1071, ""text"": ""cirrhosis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 1461, ""end"": 1470, ""text"": ""hepatitis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3155, ""end"": 3161, ""text"": ""kidney"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1741, ""end"": 1746, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3394, ""end"": 3399, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3923, ""end"": 3928, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3947, ""end"": 3952, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 4378, ""end"": 4384, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 2033, ""end"": 2039, ""text"": ""tissue"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 4441, ""end"": 4448, ""text"": ""abscess"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 314, ""end"": 324, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 4054, ""end"": 4060, ""text"": ""throat"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 314, ""end"": 324, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Bile duct"", ""Skin and soft tissue""]}",Urosepsis,4,644,2023-05-09T12:23:16.665629Z,2023-05-09T12:23:16.665664Z,111.223

demand ischemia. stat tte performed at bedside by cards fellow who reported takostumbo physiology. the next day she was bolused 6l ivns with uop increaseing to 30cc/hr with concern for under-resuscitated septic shock. lactate trended down to 1.1. noted to be in a. fib to 95-110, map in 60. repeated tte (lvef 30-35) normal left ventricular cavity size with severe global dysfunction of the distal [**2-2**] of the ventricle c/w lesion of the mid lad (wrap around) or takotsubo cardiomyopathy. significant mitral regurgitatinon (not quantified). urine lytes suggested pre-renal volume status. she was temporarily weaned off pressors but worsening cvp (nonresponsive to fluids) and new effusion on echo was concerning for tamponade vs ace. ekg showed ste in inferior leads and family wanted no aggressive interventions. she was made cmo and expired within minutes of pressor withdrawal. . #. uti (with possible urosepsis): has grossly positive ua in setting of sepsis and end organ damage.  previously treated with bactrim but unclear if organism was sensitive. continued on vanco and meropenem. it is possible that pt had urosepsis (rather than cholangitis/biliary sepsis) as postulated however pt was covered broadly. . #. acute kidney injury: likely prerenal in setting of sepsis and volume depletion, although could also be related to bactrim use vs atn given hypotension.  low urine output currently. she was bolused with ivf to adequate urine output on hd-1. . #. atrial fibrillation: in sinus rhythm on admission and noted to be in afib w rvr during decompensation however pt too untable for rate control. . #. hypothyroidism: continued on levothyroxine . #. chronic diastolic chf: presumed diagnosis based on history but not clear. ramipril and lasix held

History of Present Illness:
 88yo f, s/p billroth 2 many years ago for pud, was in usual state of health until evening prior to presentation. after dinner she discovered bright red blood in the ostomy, associated with mild epigastric tenderness.  she also reported shortness of breath, chest pressure, and light-headedness.  she denies loc, ha, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, dysuria. she does not take nsaids and is compliant with her home medications.  she presents to the [**hospital1 18**] ed.    of note, she underwent egd in [**5-2**] for pain, with the findings of 2 shallow ulcers distal to the jejunal anastamosis and gastric erythema, biopsies there were negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
 88yo f admitted to micu, general surgery consult obtained, for upper gi bleed.  she was placed npo, provided iv ppi, ivf, and serial hcts.  anginal symptoms were deemed secondary to demand ischemia from anemia.  serial hcts performed showed drop from baseline 30 to 22 to 20. received multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells, with appropriate hct response, but hct continued to drift downward. pt remained hd stable.  egd [**1-17**] showed clot and oozing in the efferent jejunal limb, which was injected.  the hematocrit continued to fall, and the pt received further transfusions.  repeat egd that evening showed oozing in the efferent jejunal limb and an identifiable vessel, which was injected and cauterized.  the patient remained hd stable but continued to require 5 more units of prbcs overnight for a total of 9 units since admission, the hct was 20.  a bleeding scan was negative.  she was therefore taken on hd 3 to the operating room for exporatory laparotomy and revision of the previous billroth 2, a feeding gastrojejunal tube was also placed.  at the time of operation, a marginal ulcer with uncontrollable bleeding was noted; please operative report for further details.    post-operatively the patient was brought to the sicu, intubated in stable condition. she was extubated on pod 1 and transfused further 3 units for downtrending hct 27 to 24. trophic tube feeds were begun and subsequently advanced.  on pod 3 she developed afib and was placed on beta-blockade; other vs and hct were stable.  on pod 5 she was begun on pod diet, tf were cycled, and she was transferred to the floor.  overnight she experienced bilious and fecal emesis, associated with cp and non-specific ekg changes.  cardiac enzymes were negative and an ngt was placed. a kub showed no evidence of obstruction, but the pt remained symptomatic.  a small-bowel follow-through was concerning for sb obstruction.  tube study did show contrast passing the anastamosis and the pt was treated conservatively and followed clinically.    on pod 7 she developed l sided weakness concerning for r mca stroke given her afib and lack of anticoagulation post-op. neurology consult obtained. head ct was negative and but mri showed r corona radiata cva. she was begun on heparin drip and transferred to the sicu for hourly neuro checks. carotid duplex were negative (<40% stenosis bl). tte showed lvef 30-40%, mild ar, mr, and mod tr. heparin was stopped and she was placed on coumadin.    the atrial fibrillation persisted despite beta-blockade, and she was switched to diltiazem, and later iv lopressor.    on pod 11 she again developed sx's concerning for obstruction v ileus, as well as an elevated wbc. a ct scan showed a transition point but with passage of contrast.  she was followed conservatively, provided tpn and trophic tf, and eventually opened up.  she was transferred to the floor, receiving pt/oob and slowly advanced on her tf.  she remained distended on pod 14 but abdominal plain films showed no dilated loops.    on pod 14 she spiked a temperature to 104, and was pan cultured and the cvl was changed and cultured.  she was placed on vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl and transferred to the sicu.  blood cultures and catheter tip cultures grew enterococcus, sensitive to levaquin; the other antibiotics were discontinued. the central line was removed and re-sited.  she defervesced and remained hd stable, and was subsequently returned to the floor. she remained on coumadin and developed a therapeutic level.  the tf were advanced very cautiously and tolerated; tpn was weaned and then stopped.  she continued to receive pt and ot.  one further transfusion was provided to bring the hct over 30; which was subsequently stable.  the foley catheter was removed and the cvl removed.  home meds were resumed.  she was accepted at [**hospital1 **] for rehab and transferred there on pod 19.",679,"[{""start"": 3737, ""end"": 3746, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 2621, ""end"": 2626, ""text"": ""bowel"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 3426, ""end"": 3431, ""text"": ""ileus"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1800, ""end"": 1806, ""text"": ""gastro"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 295, ""end"": 302, ""text"": ""gastric"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 697, ""end"": 704, ""text"": ""gastric"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 3426, ""end"": 3431, ""text"": ""ileus"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 446, ""end"": 453, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2409, ""end"": 2413, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 446, ""end"": 453, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3990, ""end"": 3998, ""text"": ""catheter"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 4512, ""end"": 4520, ""text"": ""catheter"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 4106, ""end"": 4112, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 3990, ""end"": 3994, ""text"": ""cath"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 4512, ""end"": 4516, ""text"": ""cath"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 2485, ""end"": 2492, ""text"": ""cardiac"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 414, ""end"": 425, ""text"": ""palpitation"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3247, ""end"": 3253, ""text"": ""atrial"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 355, ""end"": 360, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2246, ""end"": 2250, ""text"": ""beta"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3285, ""end"": 3289, ""text"": ""beta"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 705, ""end"": 712, ""text"": ""erythem"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 652, ""end"": 657, ""text"": ""ulcer"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1874, ""end"": 1879, ""text"": ""ulcer"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 2917, ""end"": 2922, ""text"": ""neuro"", ""labels"": [""Neurological""]}, {""start"": 3076, ""end"": 3081, ""text"": ""neuro"", ""labels"": [""Neurological""]}, {""start"": 2858, ""end"": 2864, ""text"": ""stroke"", ""labels"": [""Neurological""]}, {""start"": 334, ""end"": 353, ""text"": ""shortness of breath"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2022, ""end"": 2030, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,Catheter-associated,"{""choices"": [""Bile duct"", ""Endocarditis"", ""Skin and soft tissue""]}",4,638,2023-05-09T12:16:40.895562Z,2023-05-09T12:16:40.895600Z,193.799

(+) lightheaded, but no syncope . ros otherwise significant for chronic incisional chest pain, described as a midsternal, radiating to back and neck, unchanged in the last 6 years since her aortic valve replacement. no assoc sob, n/v, diaphoresis.

Brief Hospital Course:
 patient is a 75 year old female with af, chf, bioprosthetic aortic valve, admitted with arf after 1 week of diarrhea, mssa bacteremia from sternal wound infection, intubated for respiratory distress and acidosis, unfortunately failed extubation and at this time not an ideal candidate for trachestomy. . # respiratory failure and metabolic acidosis: initially intubated for worsening acidosis and respiratory fatigue, also appeared to have pulmonary edema on cxr. failed attempted extubation on [**12-20**], as she became tachycardic, tachypneic, hypertensive, using accessory muscles and unable to clear secretions or cough, and was subsequently re-intubated. it was thought that she failed likely due to deconditioning/overall weakness, likely component of restrictive lung disease, given kyphosis, and overloaded fluid status.  cxr continued to demonstrate pulmonary edema and vascular congestion, along with pleural effusions, however her cxr did seem improved when compared to several days ago; we were continuing to monitor cxr to help with assessment of fluid status. overall appears less fluid overloaded on exam, with much improvement in edema.  she was continued on a lasix gtt, having successfully removed 1 l/day, but lasix gtt was eventually held as she became hypotensive. the initialy plan was that if the patient failed extubation, dr. [**last name (stitle) 2230**] had been contact[**name (ni) **] and would start arrangements for tracheostomy.  patient extubated [**12-31**], initially did well then became increasingly uncomfortable, felt short of breath.  the patient wished not to be re-intubated and did not want a tracheostomy..  after extensive discussions with family and patient, decision was made for patient to be comfort measures only, as patient did not want to be re-intubated or placed on non-invasive ventilation. family at bedside and in agreement with plans for cmo.  morphine gtt was initiated, and patient passed away on [**1-2**]. . # mssa infection/sepsis of sternal wound: her shock was secondary to staph aureus wound infection in her sternum (from previous mitral valve surgery) and subsequent bacteremia. family declined any surgical intervention or drainage/debridement of wound.  initially on neo, but then weened to vasopressin, now off all pressors for several days. blood cx ([**12-8**], [**12-9**])

cipro. tee did not demonstrate any vegetations. . # chronic back pain: patient has related chronic back pain that is likely exacerbated by prolonged stay in bed. patient not on any significant pain management medications at home. as discussed earlier, osteomyelitis is less likely, and work up would not change management. pain control adequate at present, likely improved with oob to chair and working with pt.  fentanyl patch of 25 mcg initiated, using boluses as fentanyl needed, however not needed for quite some time.  tylenol atc and lidoderm patch added. . # anxiety: patiend had severe anxiety regarding extubation. family relates that patient is a ""worrier"" at baseline, but otherwise manages her anxiety on her own, and does not seek medications.  we had attempted to maximize medical management of her anxiety to assist with success of weaning from vent.  to decreased anxiety, only the on-call team would see the patient on daily rounds, and only the attending and respiratory therapist were in the room for extubation.  she was given klonopin 0.5 mg [**hospital1 **] to help with significant anxiety, ativan prn for additional anxiety. re-assuring, supportive care from family, staff. . # elevated lfts/cholestasis: resolved. previous us showed mild gallbladder distension.  will continue to monitor trend, lfts (except alk phos, trending down) and t. bili within normal limits. . # abdominal discomfort: resolved, was likely secondary to irritation from heparin injections.  attempted to transition to lovenox, so patient would only get one daily injection, however pharmacy concerned given patient's low weight and low creatinine clearance.  d/ced heparin sc as patient promised to keep on pneumoboots. . # af w/rvr:  patient developed af w/rvf, was on amiodarone drip, and was successfully cardioverted back in to nsr, flips back into af occasionally. restarted asa for anticoagulation (outpatient regimen, was not on coumadin or any other [**doctor last name 360**] as outpatient).  continued on amiodarone po 400 mg tid for 2 weeks, then changed on [**1-1**] to 400 mg [**hospital1 **] for 2 weeks (with plans to then change to 400 mg daily. metoprolol was d/c'ed, given low bp, will favor diuresing in lieu of beta blocker, as patient has not been able to tolerate both. . # anemia: no clinical evidence of bleeding.  continued b12, folate supplementation.  received 1 u prbcs on [**12-28**].  ct abd/pelvis showed no rp bleed. . # renal failure:  presented with cr 9.0, from baseline cr 2.5-2.6; presumed prerenal from diarrhea, also likely worsened by hypotension. improved with iv hydration. renal u/s completed, no evidence of hydronephrosis or obstruction.  e coli uti treated with 7 days cipro.  urine lytes, sediment have been

History of Present Illness:
 mr. [**known lastname 24078**] is a 56-year old male with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea and asthma who presents from home with one day of chills, myalgias, cough productive of yellow sputum tinged with blood and right sided chest pain. of note he was previously diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia in [**month (only) 956**] and treated with azithromycin with complete resolution of symptoms. he was feeling well until one day prior to presentation when these symptoms developed suddenly. the pain is primarily in the right side of his chest and worsens with deep inspiration. he is unable to take a deep breath secondary to pain. his breathing is worse when lying flat or on his left side. he has had myalgias and chills but has not taken his temperature at home. he has had mild nausea but no vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation. he has had blood tinged sputum for one day. he has been taking normal po intake and had normal urine output without dysuria. he denies lower extremity edema. he denies any recent travel or sick contacts. [**name (ni) **] has not been on recent steroids or other immunosuppresants. he is not a smoker. all other review of systems negative. . in the ed, initial vs were: t: 98.7 p: 116 bp: 73/45 r: 16 o2 sat: 88% on ra. he had a chest ct with contrast which showed no pulmonary embolism but showed a severe right middle and right lower lobe pneumonia. he received 5 liters of normal saline. his blood pressure ranged from the 70s to 90s systolic and he subsequently had a right sided sepsis catheter placed and was started on levophed which was soon stopped. he received levofloxacin, vancomycin, aspirin 325 mg and morphine 4 mg iv x 1, tylenol 1000 mg po x 1. he had an ekg which showed sinus tachycardia, normal axis, normal intervals, isolated 1 mm ste in lead iii which resolved on subsequent ekgs. he was admitted to the micu for further management. .

Brief Hospital Course:
 in summary, this is a 56-year-old male with sarcoidosis, osa, anxiety/depression, and hyperlipidemia who presented with shortness of breath, right sided chest pain and fevers and he was found to have multifocal right sided pna per chest ct imaging. admitted to icu for sepsis concerns in setting of hypotension to systolic range in 70s with mild tachycardia. resuscitated with generous ivfs and given iv antibiotics, supportive oxygen and briefly on levophed for blood pressure stabilization. patient hemodynamically stabilized well over [**1-28**] days in icu and never required any intubation. he was transferred to general medical floor on [**2185-5-19**]. for more detailed hospital course please see below: . #multifocal pna: patient's initial presentation was concerning for septic shock as he became tachycardic to 120s range and hypotensive to systolic 70s in the emergency room on [**2185-5-15**]. blood pressures improved with generous ivfs and he only required brief pressor support with levophed. cta chest done at admission on [**2185-5-15**] showed right sided multi-focal pna. of note, mr. [**known lastname 24078**] has pre-existing poor pulmonary reserve at baseline from his sarcoidosis and asthma. he also endured 2 previous bouts of pneumonia over the past year. he was initially started on triple coverage in the ed with levaquin, and iv vancomycin & zosyn. this was continued in the icu up until [**5-18**] when he was switched to iv ceftriaxone with continuance of levaquin. he arrived on the general medical floor on [**5-19**] but appeared to have more labored breathing later in the afternoon so a repeat cxr done and team decided to place him back on his prior vancomycin and zosyn regimen and ctx and levaquin were discontinued. the cxr done [**2185-5-19**] showed mild effusions but overall improving pneumonia in the right middle and lower lobes. he continued to have improved shortness of breath and decreasing oxygen requirements and his cough was persistent but phlegm production lessened. fevers gradually defervesced. initial blood cultures were negative. sputum gram stain showed >25 pmns and 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and chains and 2+ gram negative rods also identified. sputum culture only showed sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora. patient developed drug rash, leukocytosis and eosinophilia, zosyn was discontined. placed only on po levoquin high-dose. to complete total of 14 day course. asked to follow-up as an outpatient with his pulmonologist, dr. [**last name (stitle) **], over the next few weeks. . #sarcoidosis: mr. [**known lastname 24078**] has both pulmonary sarcoidosis and extrapulmonary manifestations of sarcoid in the form of prior uveitis flare-ups. he does not typically take any home oral steroids on an ongoing basis for his sarcoid and on chest ct on this admission his sarcoid disease appeared to be stable as compared with prior films. given his acute infection there was no role for any additional steroids on this admission. moreover, his dyspnea and respiratory congestion seemed to gradually improve on antibiotics and supportive oxygen alone. he was, however,  continued on his usual inhaled steroids with ongoing advair and albuterol nebulizers. . #obstructive sleep apnea: he was continued on his usual home nightly cpap regimen while inpatient. . #hypercholesterolemia: daily cholestyramine was continued. mr. [**known lastname 24078**] had also been enrolled to participate in a research study which included daily administration of possible statin (vs. placebo) and this protocol was completed on [**5-21**]. . #depression: during his hospital course he had occasional apparent depressed moods at times but denied any suicidal ideation and he maintained an appropriate affect after he was transferred to the general medical floor. he was continued on his usual effexor and daily clonazepam was continued for his concomitant anxiety. . #benign prostatic hypertrophy: he was given his usual home finasteride therapy and at time of discharge he will return to his usual flomax as well. he reported no difficulty with urination during his hospital course. . #exercise induced asthma: he was continued on his usual daily advair and monteleukast. in place of his prn albuterol inhaler he was given nebulizer treatments on an as-need basis q4-6 hours. . #gerd: he was continued on a ppi regimen for his severe gerd history. . #hyperglycemia / pre-diabetes: he had not been on any home standing medications for his mild to moderate hyperglycemic tendency. he had qid fingersticks and a sliding scale insulin regimen with meals and qhs. fasting and post-prandial glucose levels were predominantly normal to borderline normal for hospital course. no additional standing insulin or oral medications were added to his medications. . # fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: he had several liters of ivfs over the initial 48 hours of his hospital stay and then once he had good po intake ivfs were tapered. electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed and he was continued on a regular diet. . # prophylaxis: subcutaneous heparin was given tid for dvt prevention, ppi for gerd as above, and a bowel regimen with colace and senna was continued. . # code status: patient was maintained as a full code status for entire hospital course ;

Brief Hospital Course:
 primary reason for hospitalization: mr. [**known lastname 28445**] is a 75 year old man with history of panhypopituitarism and suspected pituitary lesion status post undiagnostic transphenoidal biopsy who presented with sepsis due to biliary obstruction from mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  patient recieved a percutaneous biliary drain and underwent a laparoscopic lymph node biopsy, results show diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl).  he underwent therapy with r-chop. . active problems by issue: # dlbcl: fna provided differential of dlbcl, follicular, or burkitt's.  laparoscopic excisional ln biopsy definitively characterize as diffuse large b-cell lymphoma.  tte for baseline cardiac assessment was grossly normal with ef>55% and no valvular abnormalities or focal hypokinesis.  lp was performed; cytology of csf shows no malignant cells.  flow cytometry of csf shows negative for malignant cells.  e was kept in the hospital for to assess need for cns treatment for lymphoma as well given his pituitary problems below, however, it was finally decided that the pituitary is not due to lymphoma.  tls labs were checked twice a day and the patient was continued on acyclovir prophylaxis and provided with caphosol mouth care.  he did not develop complications of the r-chop protocol.  he will have his continued care through dr. [**first name (stitle) **] in [**hospital3 **].  he should take filgrastim at home in between chemotherapy treatments. . # sepsis/cholangitis: patient had cholangitis secondary to biliary obstruction from large mesenteric lymphadenopathy. percutaneous biliary drain and biliary stent were placed during last hospitalization and capped prior to that discharge; perc drain was revised after patient presented again in sepsis. blood cultures drawn during sepsis grew pansensitve klebsiella, and he completed a 14 day course of piperacillin/tazobactam. patient's lfts normalized and when the biliary drain did not drain anything in 24 hrs, it was capped.  unfortunately, once he became neutropenic, he again developed sepsis and a cholangitis picture with right upper quadrant pain and elevated liver enzymes especially alkaline phosphatase.  the drain was uncapped and 650 cc of cloudy fluid was drained with immediate relief of pain, recovery of blood pressure, and resolution of fever.  he was treated with cefepime/flagyl and then stepped down to cipro/flagyl by mouth for 14 days upon discharge.  the biliary drain was exchanged for a different type by interventional radiology after the 2nd episode of sepsis.  interventional radiology recommended that the drain remain in place for 3 months until the lymphadenopathy has shrunk enough for the biliary system to stay open without the drain.  they will see him in clinic to schedule removal. . # hypernatremia: patient was hypernatremic several times in the setting of high serum osm and low urine osm.  patient was diagnosed with central di shown by ddavp test where he had 3x concentration of urine osm after ddavp prior to admission.  he was maintained for several days on desmopressin 0.05 mg once at night with normal serum sodium levels.  upon discharge he was set up with a vna to draw daily sodium levels and fax them to an endocrinologist, dr. [**first name (stitle) 4160**].  if his na is greater than 143, he is to take an additional 0.05 mg ddavp. . #guaiac positive stool.  patient had some guiac positive stools during admission and some diarrhea.  he was consistently negative for c. diff infection and it was thought that his diarrhea was due to the cathartic effect of blood.  mcv also trended down this hospitalization, more indicative of active bleeding leading to iron deficiency.  the most likely explanation for his intermittent guiac positive stools was small bleeding from his perc drain.  his hematocrit remained stable during admission and he was hemodynamically stable.  he was told that his black stools should resolve and if they do not, he should report to his pcp. . # pituitary mass/panhypopituitarism:  obtained [**hospital1 3278**] records which showed patient was found to be panhypopit after presenting in severe malaise.  was started on hydrocortisone by [**hospital3 **] endocrinologist and levothyroxine.  then, presented with diplopia and was found to have unilateral 6th nerve palsy.  mri brain showed abnormal enhancement of pituitary infundibulum. received transphenoidal biopsy, which showed normal bone in clivus and normal brain tissue in pituitary, no tumor cells.  mr brain this admission shows normal size and shape of pituitary; evidence of prior biopsy/surgery; no evidence of cns lymphoma. fsh, lh, testosterone very low.  total t4 ok (on replacement), but very low tsh on replacement levothyroxine.  patient also was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus by endocrinology this admission (see below).  he was discharged on prednisone 10 mg daily to support his adrenal function and his levothyroxine was increased to 100 daily due to constipation and 4 low-normal.  it was decided by the neuro-oncolgy tumor board that without evidence of cns lymphoma by mri, biopsy, and 2 lps it was unlikely that he had a lymphoma causing panhypopit.  he should have a repeat mri in [**4-13**] weeks and follow-up with dr. [**last name (stitle) 6570**] (neuro-oncologist) to make sure no tumor appears. . #hypercalcemia: corrected ca [**87**].9 at highest.  differential diagnosis included granulomatous dz conversion of 25vitd to 1,25vitd, paraneoplastic syndrome or bone mets (but no evidence of such on imaging).  pth low, so not primary hyperparathyroidism.  paraneoplastic syndrome was not likely since pthrp was 26, within reference range.  25-oh vitd was normal and 1,25-oh vitd was low, which is not consistent with increased conversion from lymphoma/granulomatous dz. lymphoma is not a common producer of pthrp, but could produce il-6 which stimulates osteoclastic activity.  still no clear etiology of hypercalcemia.  hypercalcemia resolved with iv hydration for hypernatremia. . # acute kidney injury ([**last name (un) **]): patient's cr was initially elevated to 1.5, likely mixed atn/pre-renal process as patient was septic.  fena > 1% suggesting atn.  urine sediment was bland. he was aggressively volume repleted in icu and cr normalized(baseline 1.0).  it was not felt that tumor lysis syndrome was contributing to this because he had a normal uric acid and ldh.  renal us showed no tumor involvement causing obstruction. . chronic problems by issue: . # hypertension (htn): patient was hypotensive in the icu when coming out of a septic picture.  he was restarted on his home lisinopril, amlodipine, and metoprolol one at a time.  at discharge, he was normotensive on his previous home regimen. . #urethral bleeding:  patient was catheterized early on transfer to the floor for ddavp test and started to have mild urethral bleeding.  it was getting progressively worse, eventually turning into gross bleeding from urethra after urination. bleeding stopped with holding pressure.  urology consultants felt this was likely foley trauma and after 3-5days it healed without intervention. . # pulmonary nodules:  patient had ct chest that showed diffuse and partly clustered micronodules with tree-in-[**male first name (un) 239**] distribution, as well as airway wall thickening and mild irregularities. unclear if this is infectious, inflammatory or malignant process. pulmonary consult believes it is a result of severe pneumonia patient states he had many decades ago. . # gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd): continued on home omeprazole. . # benign prostatic hypertrophy (bph): continued on home finasteride 5mg daily. . transitional issues: - please ensure that he continues to stay on schedule with r-chop cycles (cycle 1 completed during this admission) for his dlbcl.  he can have these at cape code hospital with dr. [**first name (stitle) **] but he should not miss any cycles if he is able to tolerate them medically - please ensure that he maintains his prednisone between 7.5 and 10 mg daily to ensure adrenal support - please monitor his serum sodium daily for the next 2 weeks. he has central diabetes insipidus and will dose his ddavp per phone recommendations from endocrinology.  he has been stable on desmopressin 0.05 mg po at night - please check hematocrit, calcium, and creatinine at follow-up to ensure that these are remaining normal - he should have a repeat mri in [**4-13**] weeks and follow-up with dr.

History of Present Illness:
  a 51-year-old male, without any significant past medical history, who was transferred from an outside hospital for cellulitis and adenitis that was not responsive to antibiotics, resulting in hypotension.  the patient stated that he was in his usual state of health until tuesday, [**2167-7-14**] when he first noted some left upper groin pain.  the groin pain became progressively worse over the next several days, and also he noted an area of erythema. he developed fevers on [**2167-7-19**].  he went to an outside hospital emergency department the following day.  at that time, he was diagnosed with cellulitis and adenitis, and was given 2 gm of ceftriaxone, and was discharged to home.  he continued to have persistent fevers to 103 and returned the following morning to the outside hospital emergency department where he was admitted for cellulitis and adenitis. he was started on ancef, but developed a diffuse erythroderma rash the day after initiation of ancef therapy, which was felt to be due to a drug rash.  on [**2167-7-22**], the day of transfer to [**hospital6 256**], the patient was still persistently spiking fevers, had an elevated white blood cell count with a bandemia, and became hypotensive despite iv antibiotics, including vancomycin, clindamycin and levaquin.  his blood pressure dropped to 70 systolic, and he was given iv fluids and started on peripheral dopamine.  at this time, arrangements were made to transfer the patient to [**hospital6 256**].  on arrival to [**hospital6 1760**], the patient was no longer on the dopamine drip and was normotensive with blood pressure's in the 100's to 110's/60's to 70's.

Brief Hospital Course:
 the patient is an 89 year old male with medical history pertinent for prior stroke and chronic indwelling foley complicated by recurrent uti in setting of bladder diverticula and possible chronic fungal infection, who now presents from his extended care facility with 3 days of lethargy. (at baseline the patient is reported to have expressive aphasia with right facial droop). the patient has been admitted multiple times previously with similar symptoms of lethargy which has been secondary to recurrent uti. the patient on admission was not noted to have fevers/chills or abdominal pain. on admission from the ed the patient was with vitals as follows: t 99.2; bp 140/73; hr 73; o2 sat 100%ra. while in the ed the patient dropped his pressure as low as 73/37 with improvement after fluids.      [**hospital unit name 153**] course: in the icu the patient was initiated on therapy with broad spectrum coverage with zosyn and vanc. microbiology review reveals the patient has had recurrent infection with e. coli, morganella morganii, group b strep, and enterococcus. the dominant organism has been e. coli which has been quinolone resistant, zosyn undeterminate (although most recent report states sensitive), sensitive to cefepime, ceftriaxone. urology was consulted with impression that the patient is not an operative candidate for his bladder diverticulum given his medical co morbidities. a ct head revealed no acute pathology, the patient was ruled out for mi and impression is that patient's agitation and delirium is from his underlying infection. the patient on admission to the icu was noted to have somnolence alternating with agitation consistent with delirium for which he received intermittent doses of haldol.    during the icu course the patient's antihypertensives were held given concern for possible urosepsis as patient had low bp on arrival. the patient's bp is reported to have recovered with fluid, did not require repeated boluses or pressors for pressure maintenance. additional review of micro data reveals that the patient had [**12-21**] blood cultures positive for enterococcus from the ed although icu note reports 1/4 bottles positive with impression of skin contaminant. he initially received broad spectrum treatment with vancomycin & zosyn. this was narrowed down to ampicillin. the patient will require 14 day course iv antibiotics for complicated uti, picc placed, he will finish treatment on [**2100-10-23**]. nitrofurantoin for suppressive tx should be resumed later. he had tte without vegetation in ed (performed for different indication), risk/benefit in this patient does not favor tee.     dysphagia with signs of aspiration were noted. we recommended peg tube placement, however they decided not to have it placed. the son understands that his father will not meet his nutritional needs and hydration needs with potential developement of dehydration, hypotension, and hypernatremia. they will reconsider it again if has difficulties at the nursing home. chem7 should be checked at the nursing home to prevent the developement of hypernatremia. we stopped his lasix and some of his antihypertensive medications because of low bp.      sacral decubitus ulcer: stage ii on wound care to be continued at the nursing home.      malnutrition, moderate -

  53 yo f with a questionable history of prior post-surgical pe, copd and bullous emphysemia admitted to [**hospital3 **] on [**2190-9-18**] with a septic bursitis of the right knee, transferred with acute onset hypoxia, hypotension, and tachycardia. . one day after attending a town fair (approximately 3-4 days prior to admission) the patient noted right knee swelling and discomfort. the patient attributed her symptoms to walking and standing at the fair and took ibuprofen. her pain and swelling worsened. over the following 2 days the patient developed associated fevers, chills. she noted malaise and general fatigue. she also endorsed a severe headache and loose stool with associated bowel incontinence. with this constellation of symptoms, the patient presented on [**2190-9-17**] to the [**hospital 11373**] ed at 2345. she was noted to have a leukocytosis (14) with bandemia (6) and to be in acute renal failure (cr 2.1). the patient underwent drainage of her right knee bursitis revealing many gram positive cocci in clusters. she also had a negative head ct and negative lp. . the patient was admitted to the medicine floor where she was started on kefzol 1g iv q6h out of concern for a septic bursitis. overnight with iv hydration, the patient's renal failure resolved. on the medical floor within 24 hours of the time of transfer, the patient developed abrupt onset of hypoxemia, tachycardia and hypotension (with a ?chest pain?). she was transferred to the [**location (un) **] icu. in the icu, she was noted to be in new-onset a. fib with a troponin leak (0.14). she received a total digoxin 0.75 mg. there was high concern for a pe. the patient was felt too unstable to travel for a cta and she was started empirically on heparin gtt. thrombolysis was considered though her recent lp was felt to be a contraindication. she received 3500cc ns over the last 24 hours. she was noted to have respiratory distress following this administration and she was given small dose of furosemide for possible volume overload. she required a neosynephrine drip to maintain blood pressure. a swan-ganz catheter was placed. her pre-transfer co 4.93, index 3.01, pa 38/20, ra 11, pcwp 17, svr 8.6, pvr 1.46. prior to transfer she received 1amp calcium gluconate for svr 6. . ros: prior to admission, no chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia, hematuria, dysuria, hematemesis, hemoptysis, productive cough, sick contacts.

Brief Hospital Course:
 a/p: 53 yo f with a questionable history of prior post-surgical pe, copd and bullous emphysemia admitted to [**hospital3 **] on [**2190-9-18**] with a septic bursitis of the right knee, transferred with acute onset hypoxia, hypotension, and tachycardia. . # hypoxic respiratory failure. she was transferred from osh with hypoxic respiratory failure already intuabeted.  a chest ct showed severe bullous emphysema that was likely leading to poor oxygenation.  additionally, there was concern for ards from systemic inflammation in the setting of her septic bursitis leading to worsening oxygenation.  she was ventilated on lung protective strategies including ardsnet volume-control and aprv.  she was treated with zosyn/vanco to cover a potential community/hospital acquired pna although no objective evidence for this was found (multiple negative endotracheal and bal sputum cultures were negative). she was treated with a course of steroids and inhaled corticosteroids/b-agonists to treat any potential copd exacerbation.  she was slowly weaned to pressure support ventilation on [**9-22**] and her peep was slowly weaned down from 15-> 10 over several days.  she was extubated on [**9-29**] but persisted to have tachypnea and profound hypoxemia despite being on a high flow mask.  given her persistent hypoxemia, she was re-intubated on [**10-1**].  a cta on [**10-1**] was performed to rule out pulmonary emboli to rule out other causes for her profound hypoxemia - this was negative.  a tte with bubble study was obtained on [**9-30**] to rule out any anatomic shunting but was also negative.  it was felt that likely her poor baseline respiratory function coupled with slowly resolving ards was likely the etiology of her persistent hypoxemia.  she was empirically started on high dose iv steroids to treat potential etiologies such as eosinophillic pna or fibrotic ards without much improvement in her respiratory status.  given her persistent vent requirements, she had a tracheostomy placed on [**10-6**] for eventual transfer to vent rehab for long term vent wean.  her settings remained at ps 5/5 at 50% fi02 on her day of discharge.  a trach collar trial was not yet attempted during her hospitalization. . # septic r knee bursitis. had a bursa tap at the osh that grew mssa with a knee arthrocentesis that did not reveal any septic knee joint involvement.  she was initially on vanco for empiric coverage which was switched to nafcillin 2g iv q6 on [**9-23**].  given rising wbc and persistent fevers, she was switched back to vanco/zosyn on [**9-26**].  ortho was consulted and performed a bursectomy in the or on [**9-27**] to complete remove the septic bursa.  her fever curve eventually trended downward, and her wbc returned to [**location 213**]; she was transitioned back to nafcillin on [**10-2**].  an additional knee arthrocentesis in the or again demonstarted sterile joint space and no joint wash-out was performed.  her stitches were removed on [**10-8**]. . her nafcillin 2gm iv q6 should be continued for 6 weeks from her bursetomy on [**2190-9-27**] (end date [**2190-11-12**]).  a picc line was placed for long term antibiotics. . # sedation:  she was initially on fentanyl/versed gtt while intubated.  she was placed on a fentanyl gtt and given valium to help her slowly wean off her sedation and not precipitate withdrawal.  please remove fentanyl patch on [**2190-10-12**]. . # fen: a peg tube was placed on [**10-6**] for long term nutrition needs given her persistent vent needs.  please continue replete full strength at 70ml/hr with 100ml free water flushes q6h. . # dmii: pt was on humalog sc sliding scale while in patient. pt's fs was in 100s-200s mostly.  pt was discharged with glipizide 2.5mg qday and metformin 500mg [**hospital1 **] which pt was on at home but re-started at a lower dose.  these can be titrated up as needed for glucose control in addition to sliding scale

History of Present Illness:
 88 yo f with h/o alzheimer's dementia, htn, and dm2 transferred from osh for evaluation by neuro out of concern for ich.  she was found in her bed today at nh diaphoretic, somnolent, lethargic, dysarthric and hypoxic to 80% on 3l nc at which time she was transferred to good samiritan ed for further evaluation.  she underwent head ct at osh ed which revealed ? of basal ganglia bleed.  she was then intubated for increasing unresponsiveness (only to painful stimuli) and for airway protection in setting of ? head bleed for transfer to [**hospital1 18**]. prior to intubation, she received lidocaine 100mg, etomidate 20mg, succinylcholine 100mg and cerebyx 1gm. . en route, she was hypotensive, initially 94/60 -> 64/31 at 9:50am.  this came up with ivf to 97/69, but fell again to 83/44 and thus neosynephrine was started. . in the ed here, initial vitals were t: none recorded bp: 111/72 hr: 76  rr: 14  o2 sat: 100% on ac (settings unclear).  she was continued on neosynephrine for sbps in the 70s and had only received 600cc ivfs prior to transfer to [**hospital1 18**].  here, she received 2l ivfs in the ed and sbps improved to 100s-110s off pressors.  ua was positive for >50 wbcs and many bacteria (no squams) and she received levofloxacin 750mg iv x1.  cxr was negative for infiltrate.  she received 1mg ativan prior to neurology consult. per rns, she was moving all extremities, with good strength in both arms, prior to the ativan (received 1mg iv x2).  on review of osh head ct, neurology felt that basal ganglia finding was more consistent with calcification as opposed to bleed and recommended repeat imaging here.  repeat imaging showed no evidence of acute intracranial process on nchct and cta head and neck. . ros:  unable to obtain given patient intubated.

Brief Hospital Course:
 88yo f with h/o cad, recurrent utis, dm2, alzheimer's dementia presents with altered mental status and sepsis. the following issues were investigated during this hospitalization: . # sepsis/hypotension/respiratory failure: resolved hypotension and was probably mostly due to hypovolemia on presentation. did meet criteria for sepsis given wbc count and tachycardia (at osh) with source of infection, clearly positive ua (culture sent on second sample after received abx and was negative) and had blossomed pneumonia on cxr. csf seemed like an unlikely source, particularly for bacterial meningitis. however, patient was treated for hsv encephalitis with acyclovir given rbcs in csf. this was later discontinued once cultures came back negative. sputum eventually grew mrsa which was treated with vancomycin and a 14 day course was completed on discharge. given a sudden decline in clinical status and increased sputum production, cefepime was also added for possible hospital acquired pna and was completed on the day of discharge. patient was difficult to wean from the vent given copious secretions which were not controlled even with scopolamine and frequent suctioning. for this reason, a trach was pursued after one failed extubation. . # altered mental status: most likely due to metabolic insult of infection (pneumonia/uti) on already demented baseline. improved markedly with lightening of sedation. initial osh ct head concerning for basal ganglia bleed for which she was transferred however review of that imaging and repeat imaging here negative for bleed. initially covered for bacterial and viral meningitis/encephalitis with ctx/vanco/amp/acyclovir however csf cultures negative and by counts on csf unlikely bacterial. again, hsv cultures were eventually negative and empiric meningitis regimen was discontinued. patient was otherwise continued on her dementia medications and upon discharge, was awake and communicative at her baseline. . # cad: no acute issues . # dm: maintained on insulin sliding scale",643,"[{""start"": 1902, ""end"": 1906, ""text"": "" uti"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 161, ""end"": 166, ""text"": ""neuro"", ""labels"": [""Neurological""]}, {""start"": 1400, ""end"": 1405, ""text"": ""neuro"", ""labels"": [""Neurological""]}, {""start"": 1562, ""end"": 1567, ""text"": ""neuro"", ""labels"": [""Neurological""]}, {""start"": 2074, ""end"": 2085, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2378, ""end"": 2387, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3189, ""end"": 3198, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 636, ""end"": 646, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2857, ""end"": 2860, ""text"": ""pna"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 470, ""end"": 478, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1836, ""end"": 1844, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 636, ""end"": 646, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",Urosepsis,None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Neurological"", ""Respiratory""]}",4,602,2023-05-09T11:05:05.390976Z,2023-05-09T11:05:05.391013Z,106.487

History of Present Illness:
 48f with copd and htn, presenting to osh with dyspnea and upper abdominal pain.  he was recently admitted to osh (2 weeks ago) with 5 day stay for presumed copd exacerbation, ?pneumonia at that time.  this started after doing some yardwork outside - thought perhaps had allergy to pollen.  sent home on o2, levofloxacin, and prednisone.  improved quite a bit at home, but again started feeling unwell yesterday.  stayed in bed all day and had poor po intake.  wife reports slightly loose bowel movements.  also c/o mild abdominal pain and seemed to have worsening breathing difficulties.  mild cough.  no fevers.  at 1 am today, asked his wife to call ems.  per wife, has depression but does not believe he would be at risk for od of any type. . he presented to osh.  o2 sat in 80s initially, started on bipap and nebs.  sats did not improve and looked fatigued, so was intubated.  pre-intubation developed hypotension and started on levophed.  of note pulse as low as 49 even with hypotension. initial k was 7.5, bnp was 8500.  he got lasix, d50, calcium, and possibly kayexalate.  also given hydrocortisone 100 mg iv, vanco, zosyn, flagyl.  medflighted to [**hospital1 18**].  en route hypotension worsened and he was started on dopamine. . in the ed, initial vs were: t97.1 p67 bp114/48 r16 o2 sat 97% on vent. lab derangements include arf, hyperkalemia, combined met/resp acidosis (7.16), transaminitis with hyperbilirubinemia.  ct abdomen without contrast performed and showed multifocal pneumonia, equivocal peripancreatic stranding (lipase normal). head ct done prior to transfer - no bleed seen.  patient was continued on pressors - currently 0.06 levophed and 15 dopa. also got zosyn here.  cvl placed.  current vent settings 550 x ?, fio2 1, peep 12, and satting low to mid 90s. . on the floor, patient intubated and unresponsive.  per ed, unresponsiveness unexplained and has persisted, ?meds from osh.

Brief Hospital Course:
 48m with copd and htn, presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure/ards and septic shock. . # ards/hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumonia.  appeared to be pneumonia on presentation(aspiration vs. cap vs. hap given recent hospitalization) unlikely to be ards given focal consolidation on initital cxr.  the patient was intubated prior to transfer and initially required fairly heavy ventilatory support- ac fio2 1.0 and peep 12 to keep sats in a good range. on hd3 the pt was transitioned to ps from ac with immediate improvement in serial abgs.  ps and peep were able to be weaned rapidly, and the pt was extubated on hd4.  post-extubation the pt was hypertensive and persistently hypoxic- this was thought to be [**1-25**] flash pulmonary edema and responded well to nitro gtt, iv enalapril and lasix.  it was thought that his hypoxia was related to a shunt phenomenon, due to the fact that his oxygen saturation did not change with large changes in his supplemental oxygen, a tte was done that was non-diagnostic due to image quality and a cta was done that ruled out a pe.  his oxygen requirement continued to decrease and on the day he was transferred to the medical service he was on room air with oxygen saturations in the low 90's.  on the floor, hypoxia continued to improve and patient saturated in the low 90s on either room air or 1-2 l nasal cannula. walked with pt, ate, all without sob or desaturation. discharged home with oxygen. . # septic shock.  presumed pulmonary source/pneumonia- made more likely with blood cultures growing gpcs, presumably peptostreptococcus.  started on broad spectrum coverage with vanc/levoflxacin/zosyn.  bps rapidly improved with bolus ivf, weaned rapidly off dopamine then levophed on hd2.  bps stable since then, eventually hypertensive which seems to be pts baseline.  he completed a 7 day course of levo/zosyn and was transferred to the medical floor with a picc in place to complete a 14 day course of vancomycin for his gpc bacteremia. discharged home with plans for vancomycin administration q24h for 4 days more to complete the course, with pcp monitoring of [**name initial (pre) **] vanc trough level. shock physiology had resolved, so patient was back on almost all of his antihypertensives (still holding atenolol on discharge) and without hypotension, and with improvement in his laboratory values that had previously been indicating septic shock. . # copd: patient with a history of copd, per his pcp prior to these episodes of pneumonia his pft's did not show severe copd. he was started on steroids, initially solumedrol, he left the icu on prednisone 40mg daily to complete a 14+ day taper.  he will need outpatient pulmonary follow up which was scheduled for him, with a better daily regimen, so he was discharged with advair and spiriva and vna for inhaler teaching. . # arf.  likely ischemic shock atn vs. prerenal.  cr trended down with resolution of sepsis. . # transaminitis.  likely shock liver.  hep serologies negative. trended down with resuscitation. . # thrombocytopenia.  unclear baseline, there seems to be some component of pancytopenia following septic event, gradually trended upward. . # leukocytosis: believed due to steroid administration. plan for outpatient vna check of cbc and faxing to pcp. . # anemia: believed d/t etoh use, septic physiology;

Brief Hospital Course:
 1) cirrhosis/sbp: mr. [**known lastname **] was started on ceftriaxone 2gm iv q24h for osh paracentesis results consistent with sbp. initial labs confirmed a hemolytic anemia, with haptoglobin <20, and a dic-like process, with low fibrinogen, elevated fdp, and schistocytes on peripheral smear. he also had very poor urine output, producing only 80ml during his first 24h in-house, with a fena<1%, consisent with prerenal or hepatorenal syndrome. he was initially treated with ffp and prbc to keep his inr around 2.5 and his hct around 25. he was also treated with albumin, per sbp protocol, and to provide volume.  ascites cultures from [**hospital 13548**]hospital did not have any bacterial growth. on day #2 of his stay. mr. [**known lastname **] grew increasingly dyspneic with worsening ascites. cxr revealed only small pleural effusions, but decreased lung volumes, believed to be compressed by his ascites. his uop had increased somewhat, and a decision was made to avoid a paracentesis, due to bleeding risk. his uop increased, ascites remained stable, and his sob resolved somewhat. he did not become encephalopathic, and was a&ox3 throughout his course. a f/u diagnostic paracentesis was done on day #3 of his stay, which did not meet criteria for sbp, and his previous antibiotic course was completed. transplant surgery was consulted and, when mr. [**known lastname **] condition had stabilized over the next 24-48h, efforts were made to facilitate an expidited liver transplant work-up. he was ordered for a tte, pfts, a social work consult, and an mri/mra with volumetrics. his nadalol was held during his acute illness period. also of note, the egd at osh showed grade i varices. . 2. hepatorenal: the pt was noted to have a creatinine of 2.2 on admission, and his baseline was 1.4 previously and possibly lower since there was only one previous measurement available on record. his clinical and laboratory picture was most consistent with hepatorenal syndrome, with a highly sodium avid state demonstrated in the urine lytes. he was given daily infusions of albumin along with octreotide and midodrine with good effect, since his creatinine trended down to 1.8 over the next several days. however for unknown reasons the renal function later deteriorated again, trending up to 4.5. during this episode of worsening, renal consult was called. the renal team agreed persued a renewed work-up and ultimately agreed with the diagnosis of hepatorenal sydrome. albumin infusions, octreotide, and midodrine were continued. after several days, there was again signs of improvement in the renal function. the patient never required dialysis. his renal function had no completely stabilized yet he wanted to leave the hospital and left ama. . 3. volume overload: on a couple of separate occasions during the hospitalization, the patient was noted be volume overloaded. as noted above, the renal function fluctuated and at points there was required albumin infusions to treat hepatorenal while the kidneys were failing and unable to clear the volume.  the patient did develop symptoms of sob and chf on cxr, as well as an elevated bnp level to 41,000. although he was never progressed past the point of feeling mild symptoms of sob. because of his history and echocardiographic findings of normal cardiac function, the etiology of the overload was assessed as a problem of clearing volume from kidneys with the added stress of massive volume with daily 50g of albumin as well as 3u prbcs over a couple of weeks. his volume status was followed clinically. renal was following as well in case of the need for dialysis if acutely overloaded, although this was avoided. . 3. anemia: the hct remained 25 range and stable during the admission. there was a question that the patient did not seem to be responding to tranfusions. the blood bank was [**name (ni) 653**], though it is unclear whether the pt is truly rbc transfusion resistant at this time. . 4. diarrhea: mr. [**known lastname **] had recently completed most of a 15-day course of flagyl for c. diff colitis. he continued to have [**6-3**] watery stools per day, and was treated empirically with flagyl. c. diff was negative and toxin b was sent which was similarly negative. he did continue to receive flagyl while on treatment doses of the ciprofloxacin.",637,"[{""start"": 199, ""end"": 208, ""text"":

likely related to toxic metabolite buildup, probably hepatic failure is biggest contributor.  would wax and wane between confusion and lucidness.  would treat aggitation with sl zyprexa.  avoided sedating meds.  pt was refusing narcotics for pain control because she could feel herself not thinking clearly.  upon discharge, patient has appropriate mental status for several days and was able to understand her situation.  likely has depression contributing at some level, too.  often is sad and crying in the morning when family is not around. . # hypoglycemia: pt has history of diabetes, but is no longer on any diabetic meds because of these low blood sugars.  is likely due to poor nutritional stores in setting of hepatic failure with poor gluconeogenesis.  endocrinology was consulted during previous admission and did not feel insulinoma was a possibility.  c peptide was likely only elevated because it is renally cleared.  pt fs was as low as 15 while in the micu.  pt was able to resume her diet and then have appropriate blood sugars.  she does need encouragement to keep appropriate po intake.  while on the general medicine floor, had a period ofo altered mental status in which she was too somnolent to eat, and to maintain sugars, we had her on a d10w gtt at 500cc/hr for about 3 days.  she became hyponatremic at that time.  her mental status improved, we were able to stop the drip and keep her on her normal po diet and her sugars did much better.  her hyponatremia also resolved.  we started her on scheduled glucose tabs, but she does not take them regularly because she does not like the taste. . # esrd/hd: on hd mwf.  needs to continue this schedule as an outpatient. . # thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy: initially ther was concern for dic. she was given vitamin k initially, however her coagulopathy is likely [**12-27**] to her hepatopathy [**12-27**] to right heart failure. her coags were followed as well as monitoring for signs of bleeding. no further intervention was necessary.  her inr is high at 2.5. she does not have any active signs of bleeding and has stable anemia with a hemoglobin between 8 and 9. . # hyperbilirubinimia: thought to be associated with congestive hepatopathy from rv hypokinesis.  we monitored her liver functions were showed increasing bilirubin.  she became more jaundiced throughout her stay.  her belly exam remained intermittently tight and distended, worsening at time, but improves often after dialysis.  she is asymptomatic.  we discussed possibly doing a therapeutic paracentesis, but with her his risk and lack of symptoms, we decided against it. . # peripheral vascular disease - the patient developed what appears to be arterial ulcers on her bilateral big toes.  they do not seem infected, but she has symptoms of pain in her heels, occassionally her hands.  we did ultrasounds studies of her abis which were 0.4 and 0.6 in r and l respectively.  we tried to control her pain with oxycodone, but patient refusing narcotic meds.  tylenol up to 2 gms daily can be used for symptom relief.",631,"[{""start"": 6223, ""end"": 6231, ""text"": ""paracent"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 6223, ""end"": 6235, ""text"": ""paracentesis"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 570, ""end"": 578, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1384, ""end"": 1392, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2091, ""end"": 2099, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 354, ""end"": 361, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 591, ""end"": 598, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1361, ""end"": 1368, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1060, ""end"": 1064, ""text"": ""bile"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 6012, ""end"": 6020, ""text"": ""jaundice"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 5945, ""end"": 5950, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 4549, ""end"": 4553, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 5838, ""end"": 5842, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 5984, ""end"": 5988, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 354, ""end"": 361, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 591, ""end"": 598, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1361, ""end"": 1368, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 172, ""end"": 176, ""text"": ""esrd"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1312, ""end"": 1316, ""text"": ""esrd"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 5313, ""end"": 5317, ""text"": ""esrd"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 36, ""end"": 48, ""text"": ""hemodialysis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2853, ""end"": 2858, ""text"": ""heart"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 5577, ""end"": 5582, ""text"": ""heart"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2972, ""end"": 2978, ""text"": ""atrial"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3291, ""end"": 3295, ""text"": ""beta"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 6388, ""end"": 6393, ""text"": ""ulcer"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 226, ""end"": 233, ""text"": ""seizure"", ""labels"": [""Neurological""]}]",Gastrointestinal,None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Abdominal"", ""Urosepsis"", ""Endocarditis"", ""Skin and soft tissue""]}",4,590,2023-05-09T10:54:31.450052Z,2023-05-09T10:54:31.450081Z,120.755

consulted for ?biopsy (given concern for possible lymphoma/transition point) and recommended conservative management with ivf, npo and ngt to suction.  sbo clinically resolved and ngt d/c'd.  repeat ct showed enlargement of the abscess, which contained air, barium, fluid with surrounding inflamation of the sigmoid colon and fat stranding. the findings were suggestive of a possible fistulization between the colon and abscess. the patient was initially treated with two week course of iv linezolid. ct guided aspirate culture grew vancomycin resistant enterococcus. he was kept npo and received his nutrition via tpn. the ct guided drain continued to drain the collection.  given the patient's high expected surgical morbidity and mortality, he was managed with expectant management. follow-up imaging over the next 2 months revealed gradual improvement of the fluid collection.  the drain ultimately fell out with no evident of re-expansion of the fluid collection. the follow-up imaging did not reveal persistence of the fistulous tract from the colon to the abscess. . although the abscess is being treated with antibiotics, surgery consult has followed periodically for possible operative management of abscess and diverticulitis. as part of planning any surgery that could involve removal of part of the colon, imaging of the entire colon, ie to screen for co-incident cancer, would be required. because of the patient's diverticular disease complicated by abscess, barium enema carries a risk of re-injuring the diverticulum that was associated with the abscess and is therefore relatively contraindicated, given the recent occurence of the abscess. virtual colonoscopy, which has limited value in patients with diverticular disease, is contraindicated for the same reason, as insufflation of air in teh colon could perforate the recently abscessed diverticulum. colonoscopy was attempted, but the patient's blood pressure response to sedation limited sedation and anesthesia and the endoscope could not be advanced beyond the sigmoid with the maximal level of sedation attained. he will therefore need repeat colonoscopy when healthier over all to screen for colon cancer, and further discussion of sigmoidectomy to prevent future diverticulosis. . similar to the brain abscess above, he will need repeat imaging with ct of abdomen and pelvis in [**12-23**] weeks and will then visit his id/hiv specialist dr [**last name (stitle) **] to discuss duration of antibiotic therapy.",626,"[{""start"": 3753, ""end"": 3762, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]},

 #. gi bleed: the patient had an initial hematocrit of 18 at osh with increase of hematocrit to 26 with 3 units prbc transfused at the outside hospital. he had bright red blood on rectal exam in the [**hospital1 18**] ed with ng lavage positive for blood that did not clear with 500cc. hepatology was consulted and since he stabilized with no further bleeding, he was not scoped immediately. he was continued on an octreotide drip for 72 hours and transitioned from pantoprazole drip to iv twice daily dosing. he underwent egd which showed showed portal hypertensive gastropathy, severe esophagitis and grade 1 varices at the ge junction that could not be banded. he was given a total of 8 units of blood through the admission. he was initiated on naldolol. the patient was also noted to have small blood clots in flexiseal with a slowly down-trending hematocrit. he underwent flex-sig that showed no active signs of bleeding but a posterior anal fissure as well as diverticulosis and grade 1 internal and external hemorrhoids. hematocrit remained stable through the patient's hospitalization.    outpatient issues: the patient may require repeat endoscopy under mac for variceal banding. the patient will need a complete colonoscopy upon discharge from rehab. . #. ascites due to cirrhosis: patient with chronic alcohol abuse and stigmata of chronic liver disease on exam. ruq u/s was consistent fatty liver with nodular contour which is consistent with cirrhosis. likely from etoh etiology. hepatitis serologies were negative.   outpatient issues: follow-up with hepatology at [**hospital1 18**]. [**month (only) 547**] is the first available with any of the liver doctors [**first name (titles) **] [**last name (titles) 18**]; patient was booked for this appointment. the administrative assisstant in hepatology is going to check with dr. [**last name (stitle) **] to see if this is clinically safe. if it is not, the hepatology department will fit him in sooner and contact his ecf with appointment information. . #. altered mental status: patient with evidence of encephalopathy on exam, also with chronic alcohol abuse and with renal failure. improved with lactulose/rifaxamin, treatment of infection, and dialysis. his mental status was at baseline at the time of transfer to the floor was alert and oriented to person, place, and time.   outpatient issues: continuation of lactulose and rifaxamin, titrating the lactulose to [**3-3**] bowel movements daily. . #. hypothermia/leukocytosis: patient with hypothermia and leukocytosis upon admission in the ed in the setting of an upper gi bleed. likely felt secondary to sepsis. improved with treatment of upper gi bleed. . # spontaneous bacterial peritonitis- the patient underwent diagnostic paracentesis with cell count consistent with sbp (wbc 910 51% pmns). he was started on empiric ceftriaxone. cultures ultimately grew pseudomonas, and his antibiotics was broadened to zosyn and vancomycin. he completed a 5 day course of antibiotics and was transitioned to prophylactic ciprofloxacin. however, the patient experienced hypotension with systolic bps in the 70s which did not improve with ivf.  he required transfer back to the micu were antibiotics were broadended to meropenem and vancomycin.  diagnostic tap during the patient's second icu course revealed a gram stain with 3+ pmns; however, no organisms were isolated. the patient was continued on meropenema and vancomycin through the patient's second icu course. while on the general medicine floor, the patient was continued on meropenem and vancomycin. id was consulted for management of antibiotics and recommeded a 14 day course of meropenem and a 7 day course of vancomycin. the patient completed a course of vancomycin dosed with hemodialysis. patient will have another 2 days of meropenem to complete a total of 14 days for treatment of sponatenous bacterial peritonitis. after completion of meropenem, the patient should take 250mg ciprofloxacin daily for prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.    outpatient issues: continuation of meropenem for another 2 days to complete a 14 day course. after completion of meropenem, start 250mg ciprofloxacin daily for prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. . # sepsis- following discontinuation of antibiotics the patient experienced hypotension with blood pressures in the 70s systolic.  he was given fluid bolus with little response and subsequently transferred back to the micu where he required initiation of pressors (levophed).  given patient's known infection and recent discontinuation of antibiotics, the patient's presentation was consistent with sepsis. antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin and meropenem given sepsis. through the patient's icu course, he was weaned from levophed after midodrine and octreotide were started. upon arrival to the general medicine floor from the patient's second icu stay, the patient remained afebrile and vital signs were stable. . # rash: dermatology consulted and biopsy of skin revealed pseudomonus. the patient was started on topical gentamicin. this medication was discontinued prior to discharge as rash was noted to improve. the patient will follow up with dermatology as an outpatient.   outpatient issues: patient is scheduled for outpatient follow-up with dermatology at [**hospital1 18**]. . #. acute renal failure: patient with cr 6.8 at the outside hospital. initially, this was felt to most likely be secondary to acute tubular necrosis. he required initiation of cvvh in micu due to hypotension. blood pressure improved and patient transitioned to hemodialysis upon transferring to regular floor. hepatitis serologies were negative and ppd was negative. hemodialysis was continued through the patient's second course in the icu as well as his stay on the medicine floor prior to discharge. on the medicine floor prior to discharge, patient was on a monday, wednesday, friday schedule.   outpatient issues: continuation of hemodialysis as an outpatient as well as nephrocaps to be taken daily. follow-up with renal at [**hospital1 18**]. . #. anion gap metabolic acidosis: metabolic acidosis with gap of 15, felt secondary to uremia. resolved and improved with dialysis. on day of discharge, patient with bicarbonate or 26.",621,"[{""start"": 1001, ""end"": 1008, ""text"": ""ascites"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 2922, ""end"": 2929, ""text"": ""ascites"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 1015, ""end"": 1023, ""text"": ""paracent"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 1015, ""end"": 1023, ""text"": ""paracent"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 4406, ""end"": 4414, ""text"": ""paracent"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 4406, ""end"": 4414, ""text"": ""paracent"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 3030, ""end"": 3033, ""text"": ""ruq"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 104, ""end"": 109, ""text"": ""bowel"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 4100, ""end"": 4105, ""text"": ""bowel"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 282, ""end"": 287, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2223, ""end"": 2229, ""text"": ""gastro"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2878, ""end"": 2883, ""text"": ""colon"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 3007, ""end"": 3012, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3059, ""end"": 3064, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3317, ""end"": 3322, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 1983, ""end"": 1987, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2937, ""end"": 2946, ""text"": ""cirrhosis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3111, ""end"": 3120, ""text"": ""cirrhosis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3149, ""end"": 3158, ""text"": ""hepatitis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 7315, ""end"": 7324, ""text"": ""hepatitis"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 114, ""end"": 121, ""text"": ""urinary"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3790, ""end"": 3797, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 7014, ""end"": 7021, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 7725, ""end"": 7732, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 292, ""end"": 297, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 5410, ""end"": 5422, ""text"": ""hemodialysis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 7266, ""end"": 7278, ""text"": ""hemodialysis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 7372, ""end"": 7384, ""text"": ""hemodialysis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 7640, ""end"": 7652, ""text"": ""hemodialysis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1252, ""end"": 1259, ""text"": ""erythem"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 7145, ""end"": 7153, ""text"": ""necrosis"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1365, ""end"": 1373, ""text"": ""gangrene"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1423, ""end"": 1431, ""text"": ""gangrene"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1281, ""end"": 1285, ""text"": ""skin"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 6679, ""end"": 6683, ""text"": ""skin"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 6637, ""end"": 6641, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 6808, ""end"": 6812, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 7145, ""end"": 7153, ""text"": ""necrosis"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}]",None of the above,Skin and soft tissue,"{""choices"": [""Abdominal"", ""Bile duct"", ""Urosepsis""]}",4,580,2023-05-09T10:41:53.689618Z,2023-05-09T10:41:53.689656Z,138.342

 epigastric pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
 mr. [**known lastname **] is a 60 y.o male with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% and icd who presented to [**hospital6 **] with epigastric chest pain and shortness of breath. at [**hospital1 487**], he was found to have a left bundle branch block that was not known to be old and as such was taken to the cath lab. the lbbb was later noted to be old, however during cath he was noted to have a total occlusion to the om2 as well as 2 tight lesions in the rca. of note, the patient had been found to have inferior septal ischemia on a stress test during outpatient workup. in the cath lab, the patient subsequently developed acute shortness of breath, at which point he was given 100mg of lasix and started on a nitroglycerin drip. his symptoms did not improve, at which point he was intubated and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed through right femoral access. he also received angiomax and 300mg of clopidogrel. a swan was placed which showed elevated pulmonary artery pressures and wedge pressures between 37-44. laboratory exam at [**hospital1 487**] was significant for na 129, k 4.1, bun 53, cr 1.3, hemoglobin 16.6 and platelets of 135. her pt was 19.4 and inr was 1.8. dig level of 0.8, and cardiac enzymes significant for ck of 135, mb of 7 and troponin of 0.08 which was negative in their reference range. . review of systems could not be obtained due to intubation.

Brief Hospital Course:
 60 year old man who presented to an outside hospital emergency room with epigastric pain and shortness of breath, who was subsequently taken to the cath lab after being found to have a lbbb which was later demonstrated to be old. the patient subsequently became dyspneic in the cath lab, was intubated, became hypotensive, and an iabp was placed with phenylephrine started. he was subsequently transferred to the [**hospital1 18**] ccu for further care. . # shock and dyspnea: the patient initially had elevated biventricular elevated filling pressures, increased cardiac output and low svr.  he was therefore thought to have distributive shock with potential sepsis.  our initial chest x-ray after new og tube placement showed a collapsed right upper lobe of his lung which later resolved after replacement of the og tube.  he was pan-cultured and started on broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and zosyn, later switched to vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.  his pressors remained marginal, and he required levophed to maintain maps >65.  due to persistently adequate cardiac output readings from his swan, his intra-aortic balloon pump and swan were removed.  repeat chest x-rays showed pulmonary edema and acute exacerbation of his systolic congestive heart failure. extubation was attempted on [**2182-11-1**], but afterwards his oxygenation decreased acutely most likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.  he failed a trial of bipap and became acutely agitated, requiring emergent re-intubation.  he was subsequently aggressively diuresed with iv boluses of furosemide in addition to a furosemide drip with metolazone. after the initial diuresis, he was transitioned to torsemide po and developed hyponatremia. the torsemide dose was adjusted to 10 mg and he appears to be at his dry weight today of 200 pounds. he is ambulating on ra with o2 sats in high 90's, no peripheral edema and clear lung sounds. given his very low ef, he should be started in spironolactone and digoxin as his bp allows. please weight daily and adjust diuretics to maintain weight at 200 pounds. he is being considered for a heart transplant and transplant workup was started during this hospital stay. he will follow up with dr.

 75yo man presented from nursing home with dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxemia and fever to 103. according to rehab records, he was found to be in respiratory distress at 8am the morning of admission. he had o2sat of 76% ra, which increased to 81% on 2l nasal canula. otherwise, vitals at that time were 179/95, 140, 32, and temp of 103.3. fs was 190. he was given im lasix 40mg. of note, he has had multiple prior episodes of pneumonia per records and recently completed a 10d course of levaquin (completed on [**2163-2-4**]). . in ed, his vitals were as follows: (104.6, 163 -> 96, 142/90, 37, 100% on nrb). he was intubated (after succ/etomidate) and sedated with fentanyl/versed. blood cultures were sent. cxr and cta demonstrated bilateral basilar consolidations. otherwise, there was no pe or other acute pathology on the cta. ua was negative. he received empiric antibiotic coverage with vanco/levaquin/flagyl. he received 6l of isotonic fluids. his initial labs were notable for wbc count of 9.2 with 20% bands. anion gap of 14 and lactate of 3.6. initial abg was 7.36/29/293/17. despite volume resuscitation, his sbp trended down from 120's to 90's (nadir of 74/48) over his ed course.

Brief Hospital Course:
 in brief, the patient is a 75 year old man with history of copd, dm, cad, presents with respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumononia c/b septic shock. . 1.) respiratory failure - the patient presented with respiratory failure secondary to probable aspiration pneumonia. a speech and swallow eval showed no overt signs of aspiration however his clinical picture was consistent.  he was intitially intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and later successfully weaned. his breathing improved with antibiotics and bronchodilators.  by time of discharge his oxygenation  was normal. sputum culture showed rare growth of e. coli which was sensitive to quinolones.  he  will complete a 14 day total course of antibiotics. . 2.) septic shock - the patient initially met criteria by marked fever, bandemia, tachypnea, tachycardia as well as suspected infection, hypotension, and elevated lactate. he was transiently on vasopressor therapy.  his blood pressure stabilized.  given his recent illness, his home dose of metoprolol was discontinued.  anti-hypertensive therapy can be resumed as needed as outpatient, with the possibility of including an acei or [**last name (un) **] with regard to his diabetes. . 3.) copd. the patient had secondary bronchospasm following the aspiration pneumonia.  he continued to improve with bronchodilator therapy and inhaled corticosteroids.  he will continue nebulizers and inhaled steroids via a spacer. . 4.) anemia: this was stable over the course of his hospital stay. iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency for which he was started on supplementation.  an outpatient gi eval could be considered for evaluation of chronic blood loss. . 5.) dm ii; the patient had adequate control of blood sugars during his blood sugars.  his blood sugars were managed with sliding scale insulin during his hospital stay.  he will be discharged on his home regimen.  as above, if his blood pressure tolerates, an acei or [**last name (un) **] could be introduced. . 6.) f/e/n. diabetic diet with ground consistency and thin liquids per s&s consult. a video swallow study could be performed if the patient shows persistent signs of aspiration. . 7.) ppx. subq heparin, ppi. . 8.) psychiatry: there were no acute issues.  given his initial stressed state his home psychiatric regimen was held.  this can be resumed at time of discharge.",610,"[{""start"": 1572, ""end"": 1579, ""text"": ""swallow"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 3374, ""end"": 3381, ""text"": ""swallow"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2246, ""end"": 2250, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2409, ""end"": 2413, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 2717, ""end"": 2722, ""text"": ""pacer"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 205, ""end"": 216, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1366, ""end"": 1377, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1446, ""end"": 1457, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1495, ""end"": 1506, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1707, ""end"": 1718, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 485, ""end"": 494, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1548, ""end"": 1557, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2567, ""end"": 2576, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1802, ""end"": 1808, ""text"": ""bronch"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2529, ""end"": 2535, ""text"": ""bronch"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2608, ""end"": 2614, ""text"": ""bronch"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1337, ""end"": 1341, ""text"": ""copd"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2497, ""end"": 2501, ""text"": ""copd"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 25, ""end"": 34, ""text"": ""tachypnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 116, ""end"": 125, ""text"": ""tachypnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2090, ""end"": 2099, ""text"": ""tachypnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 675, ""end"": 683, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1685, ""end"": 1693, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 107, ""end"": 114, ""text"": ""dyspnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1399, ""end"": 1409, ""text"": ""aspiration"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1537, ""end"": 1547, ""text"": ""aspiration"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1610, ""end"": 1620, ""text"": ""aspiration"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2556, ""end"": 2566, ""text"": ""aspiration"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3448, ""end"": 3458, ""text"": ""aspiration"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",Respiratory,None of the above,,4,569,2023-05-08T11:31:47.584171Z,2023-05-08T11:31:47.584209Z,27.853

 abdominal pain

History of Present Illness:
 ms. [**known lastname 56684**] is a 80 yo f nh resident with pmhx of dm2, htn, dementia, pod admitted for a lower abdominal abscess from perforated diverticulosis. patient was transferred from osh for abdominal pain/distention, found to have ct with a possible bladder rupture which turned out to be an abscess. i&d was performed on [**4-13**] with drain placed. currently, the patient has feculant material coming from the drain from a presumed fistula. per the surgical team, the patient is not an operative candidate.

Brief Hospital Course:
 80 yof with dm, htn, dementia, diverticulosis/gib who was admitted to sicu after found to have perforated diverticulosis/abdominal abscess/fistula which is now s/p drainage/i&d and 3 wk course of vanc/zosyn, whose post-op course complicated by re-intubation for chf vs aspiration pna, extubated after diuresis; also with tachy-brady (atrial tach, asymptomatic bradycardia) syndrome and malnutrition.  during this hospitalization, her goals of care were changed to be dnr/dni and goals were shifted towards comfort care after discuassion with hospice and family.  she will f/u with hospice at her nursing facility on discharge. . 1. respiratory failure: unclear if truly chf vs aspiration pneumonia, but pt with bilateral pleural effusions and vascular engorgement reflective of gross volume overload. she was intubated on admission and intubated a second time through admission, however was extubated after diuresis. she was called out of the icu and diuresed further, and had no further respiratory issues through admission, was satting well on ra and not tachypneic by discharge. she was kept on aspiration precautions, had s/s evaluation showing that she can tolerate soft solids and should have nutritional supplement with meals and 1:1 supervision during eating. . 2. abscess: pt was admitted to sicu septic from abdominal abscess. taken to or and is s/p i&d with feculent material draining into ostomy bag several days after procedure. assumed fistula between gi tract, abscess, and skin; however pt not a surgical candidate given poor nutritional state. she was therefore treated with 3 wks of vanc/zosyn with no further signs of infection.  she was discharged with an ostomy bag draining the fistula. . 3. tachy/bradycardia: pt noted to have runs of narrow complex svt through sicu and started on metoprolol; then noted to have bradycardia and beta blockade held. ep was consulted and did not feel any intervention warranted. off beta blockade, had fewer episodes of bradycardia and noted to have 4.5 second pauses, so transferred to ccu for further monitoring. after transfer to the ccu, a family meeting was held to discuss the possibility of pacemaker placement, however not consistent with goals of care which are to avoid further interventions and procedures.  pt was discharged off of her bblocker given risk of bradycardia, and hrs in the low 100s were tolerated. . 4. mental status: has baseline dementia with superimposed delirium, although unclear whether this may also be her new baseline mental status. she was occasionally oriented to person only, alert and conversational but oftentimes lethargic, but would respond to voice and carry conversational. she was often inattentive though. she could do days of the week forward with frequent prompting and months of the year forward to about [**month (only) 216**], again with frequent prompting. she had improved greatly through her course though with ability to state days of the week backwards in the week prior to discharge and at baseline ms per family . 5. nutrition: pt with low albumin precluding fistula repair. in discussion with surgery, she was a poor candidate for peg placement her hx of pulling tubes.  dobhoff was placed but then pulled by pt.  discussion of goals of care was held with family and palliative care, who opted for no further interventions to help improve pts nutrition other than supervision while eating and nutritional supplements. . 6. htn/pump: she was continued on metoprolol (as above, continued on it after pacer placement), lasix, valsartan, simva, baby asa. she had an echo while admitted that showed ef 60% but with some evidence of diastolic failure through elevated pulmonary pressure. she was grossly anasarcatous but unlikely due to chf, more likely due to poor albumin and overly aggressive volume resuscitation.  her bblocker was held due to her bradycardia, and simvastatin and asa were dc'd on discharge given newly defined goals of care.  she was discharged on a smaller dose of lasix than what she was taking on admission due to her poor po intake. . 7. dm: continued on regular insulin sliding scale with good control. . 8. anemia: hct's stable through admission. has h/o gib, was continued on ppi. ostomy contents were guaic and were positive, so likely having chronic slow ooze from gi tract. hct 27 and stable on discharge. . 8. goals of care: extensive goals of care discussion was held by medical team, palliative care and pts family whose goals are towards comfort.  therefore, pacemaker and peg tube placement were not done and medications were minimized on discharge.  she was permitted to maintain hr in the 100s given decision not to place pacemaker.  hospice has been notified at her rehab facility and the family will follow up with them on discharge. family also expressed interest in not rehospitalizing, however this will need to be further addressed by hospice on discharge. pts code status was changed to dnr/dni during the hospitalization. . comm: [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**known lastname 56684**] (in [**country **]) [**telephone/fax (1) 86637**].

 left flank pain

History of Present Illness:
 52 year old woman with mpd/mds, ~ 1 year s/p sibling related allo sct with busulfan/cytoxan pre-conditioning therapy [**2167-10-27**], hx of gvh of liver [**5-/2168**] currently c1d20 of rituxan with nplate, she presents with left flank pain for several days and tachypnea. on [**9-30**] she developed fevers treated with moxifloxicin qod. for the past several days she has c/o intermittent but persistent l. sided flank pain for several days. she was seen in clinic on [**10-7**] and had a cta chest that showed no pe, increase in left effusion, trace right effusion, decreased bibasilar peribronchiolar opacities with slight increase in peripheral right upper lobe opacities and splenomegaly with incompletely visualized wedge shaped perfusion defect in spleen concerning for splenic infarct. she was referred to the ed for further evaluation. . in the ed, triage vs: 98.2 93 142/75 18 98% 4l nc. fast scan negative. she underwent ct abdomen that showed severe splenomegaly with some low attenuation geographic regions that may suggest early splenic infarctions, bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with increased size of the left effusion since the examination earlier today. she was given cefepime, vancomycin, morphine, dilaudid and zofran. . on the floor, she was continued on vancomycin and cefepime for prseumed pneumonia. she undewent thoracentesis of the left pleural effusion with removal of 80-100cc exudative fluid with presence of fibrin clots in serosanguinous fluid and a chest tube was placed. there was a question on follow up cxr about chest tube position. she underwent limited chest ct following this that demonstrated supra-diaphragmatic placement on the chest tube. the chest tube has put out about 20cc of fluid since placement. she was placed on a morphine pca and ativan for pain/anxiety control with some improvement in her symptoms. she continues to be tachypnic to the thirties with oxygen saturations in the low 90s on 5l face mask (mouth breather)(mid 80s on room air), using accessory muscles. she is having increasing secretions. she triggered this morning for tachypnea and nursing concern. blood pressures 90s systolic on floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
 52 yo female with history of mpd/mds, s/p bmt 1 yr ago, who is admitted with fevers, neutropenia/pancytopenia and splenic infarct and splenomegaly, transferred to [**hospital unit name 153**] with acute respiratory distress, with rapidly expanding left pleural effusion. chest tube placed [**10-9**] pm drained ~920 cc of blood-colored thin fluid. improved on abx, then developed rll presumed vap, found to be stenotrophomonas, [**last name (un) 36**] to ceftaz (bactrim best but patient has sulfa allergy, resistant to levoflox). on broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc/voriconazole/ceftazidime/acyclovir ppx) id following, initially was on stress dose steroids, now weaned to daily iv 20mg dose for gvhd. . active issues: # hypoxic respiratory failure: initially due to white out of left lung likely due to pneumonia/rapidly expanding serosanguinous pleural effusion. her ct scan revealed pan lobar consolidation of lul/ lll and patchy involvement in the rll too with drainage of the pleural space with the chest tube. bronch [**2168-10-11**] showed very thick, purulent secretions, obtained samples. patient was continued on abx regimen since culture data nonspecific/pending (vanc/[**last name (un) 2830**]/voriconazole/levoflox/acyclovir ppx). pna and effusions improved dramatically around the 7th, but since the 9-10th, cxr shows worsening rll process, likely infiltrate. patient was ct scanned which corroborated with infiltrate as opposed to edema and patient was bronch'ed on [**10-17**], minimal secretions noted, growing stenotrophomonas [**last name (un) 36**] to ceftaz (bactrim best but patient has sulfa allergy; resistant to levoflox). patient continued on ceftaz(course length to be dictated by id, likely 2 wks), vancomycin(today [**10-23**] is day [**9-12**], can stop afterwards), vori (can d/c, will need to f/u with id), & acyclovir ppx. chest tube has since been removed with no complications. patient initially headed to tracheostomy route but ended up responding beautifully to ceftaz and was extubated [**2168-10-22**]. she was transitioned back to the floor but on [**10-28**] became acutely tachypneic and hypoxic and was transferred back to the icu. antifungal coverage had been changed to micafungin on [**10-27**]. cxr showed worsening r sided pleural effusion and she underwent therapeutic thoracentesis with placement of a pigtail catheter with drainage of >1l serosanguinous fluid, exudative which was removed [**11-1**]. she was started on vancomycin at time of icu transfer for possible worsening on chest ct of infectious process. sputum gs showed 3+ gpcs in pairs. induced sputum was sent. she was weaned to 3l nc with rr in 20s and was deemed stable for transfer back to floor on [**10-30**]. she subsequently developed worsening tachypnea and hemoptysis on [**11-4**] and was transferred back to the icu. she became increasingly hypoxic relatively rapidly and hct was noted to be falling. after a discussion with her, her husband, and the bmt team, the decision was made to intubate the patient for hypoxia and airway protection. she also required plt and prbc transfusion at this time. follow up chest imaging revealed a possible empyema vs complex loculated effusion with rind. thoracic surgery placed a new chest tube on the right while intubated with some effect. antibiotics were broadened to include tigecycline but the patient continued to require maximal ventilatory support. . # acute on chronic renal failure: etiology likely oliguric atn in setting of sepsis. baseline cr of 1.3-1.4, went as high as 3.3, with metabolic acidosis and electrolyte derrangements. at first tried to balance with respiratory alkalosis through ventilator settings but it became apparent after 1-2 days in the icu that she would benefit from dialysis. cvvh was initiated with great results, improvement in ph, electrolytes, & fluid balance. on [**10-18**], patient was started on hd, which she tolerated well. making small amounts of urine on [**2170-10-18**]. patient now recovering with increased uop with no acute indication for hd and will likely not require further. would trial diuretics if volume overload becomes an issue though currently is auto-diuresing. renally dose meds. renal following closely. hd line pulled [**10-30**]. . # bp instability: patient hyper and hypotensive at times, likely [**3-9**] to sepsis, anxiety, fluid overload at times. responded to boluses currently when hypotensive earlier in course. she became increasingly hypotensive during her last micu course, requiring 2 pressors at maximal dosage. after a discussion between the patient's husband and hcp and her outpatient [**month/day (2) 5564**], the decision was made to not escalate care further given overall prognosis. the patient expired with her family at the bedside on the evening of [**2168-11-6**]. postmortem exam was declined by the family. . # anemia: likely multifactorial, [**3-9**] to blood loss from low platelets, hemolysis, and anemia of chronic disease. was guaiac pos but no evidence of active bleeding, on gi prophy. chest/abd ct from [**10-19**] found no evidence of bleeding. have been following hcts [**hospital1 **] and transfusing with goal of hct>24. . # thrombocytopenia: likely due to a combination of poor synthesis due to mds and sequestration. have been trending counts & transfusing with current goal >20 per bmt. . # mds s/p sct and pancytopenia: s/p transplant from sister [**2167-10-27**]. 85% donor on last evaluation. she remains neutropenic on gcsf g-csf and nplate, afebrile now. awaiting test of peripheral chimerism to see if current marrow mostly her own or if her donor marrow is still taking. concern for evolution into aml given peripheral circulating blasts.  will continue folic acid, neupogen as per bmt team. ivig therapy was given on [**2168-10-11**]. pentamidine per bmt for pcp [**name initial (pre) 1102**]. . . inactive issues: . # gvhd: past gvh of skin and liver: have continued to monitor lfts, on baseline 20mg iv steroids daily, changed to 30mg iv methylprednisolone [**hospital1 **] on [**10-30**]. . # hsv lesions (perineal): continue

Brief Hospital Course:
 77yo f with nine day [**hospital3 **] course notable for findings of pna and pe, presenting with worsening hypoxia. . # hypoxia - patient with progressively worsening hypoxia, with known pna and pulmonary emboli on osh imaging. it was felt that the patient likely had an underlying infectious process driving the gradual worsening of her medical condition, especially given limited community acquired pneumonia treatment at outside hospital. the pulmonary emboli was felt to possibly be worsening, precipitating her decline although this was not able to be confirmed given she was far too ill to travel for a cta; this was felt to be less likely in the setting of her supratherapeutic inr, recent lovenox administration, and her ivc filter placement. the patient's abg showed significant a-a gradient, her pao2/fio2 was suggestive of ards as were her cxrs on admission (bilateral fluffy infiltrates). the patient developed worsening respiratory distress upon arrival (hypoxia, shortness of breath, tachypnea) and was intubated/sedated shortly after presentation. her antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin and meropenem and cultures drawn (blood, urine, sputum). there was no growth to date by the time the patient expired. she was maintained on ardsnet protocol but required paralysis with cisatracurium for high plateau pressures, dysyncrony with the vent, and high tidal volumes prior to paralysis. . # sepsis/multiorgan failure - the patient continued to decompensate with rising lactate, lfts, inr, creatinine. her blood pressures dipped into the systolic 80s and was gradually broadened to vasopressin, levophed and neosynephrine for pressors. she was aggressively volume resuscitated and her pressures were fluid responsive. she was also started on stress dose steroids. despite aggressive resuscitation measures, however, her lactate, lfts, inr and creatinine continued to climb. in discussions with the family, she was made dnr/dni and ultimately comfort measures only. pressor support was discontinued and the patient passed away shortly thereafter, with her husband, children and extended family at the bedside. because of her rapid decompensation, the family requested autopsy to be performed. . # tachycardia - the patient presented with tachycardia, hr110s and initially in sinus rhythm. thus, it was felt that she was most likely septic and hypovolemic with low urine output and dry mucus membranes. at the time, her creatinine was normal. the patient received aggressive ivf rehydration (6 liters overnight) but continued to be persistently tachycardic and eventually transitioned in atrial fibrillation/flutter. the patient received one bolus of amiodarone without improvement in her heart rate, requiring uptitration of her neosynephrine, so further amiodarone was discontinued. . # supratherapeutic inr - inr >4 on admission, likely in setting of poor coumadin processing in septic physiology, with antibiotics. the patient was treated with vitamin k. she continued to develop worsening inr (up to 6) with worsening liver function during this hospitalization. . # elevated troponin - reportedly elevated troponin at osh and here as well. initially troponing here was 0.16 with flat mb, no chest pain, twi on v1-3 on ekg. gradually ck bumped but not the mb or mbi. it was felt that the patient likely had some demand ischemia. her echo showed depressed ejection fraction of 30% but without focal wall motion abnormality.",606,"[{""start"": 984, ""end"": 993, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 125, ""end"": 128, ""text"": ""ruq"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 974, ""end"": 982, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1000, ""end"": 1007, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 4136, ""end"": 4141, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 420, ""end"": 424, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 1000, ""end"": 1007, ""text"": ""dysuria"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2248, ""end"": 2253, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3478, ""end"": 3483, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 942, ""end"": 953, ""text"": ""palpitation"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3802, ""end"": 3807, ""text"": ""heart"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3701, ""end"": 3707, ""text"": ""atrial"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 930, ""end"": 935, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 4309, ""end"": 4314, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1060, ""end"": 1064, ""text"": ""skin"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1040, ""end"": 1047, ""text"": ""myalgia"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1050, ""end"": 1054, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 2032, ""end"": 2043, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1500, ""end"": 1509, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1294, ""end"": 1303, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1545, ""end"": 1554, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 135, ""end"": 140, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2076, ""end"": 2095, ""text"": ""shortness of breath"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 100, ""end"": 103, ""text"": ""pna"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 172, ""end"": 175, ""text"": ""pna"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1168, ""end"": 1171, ""text"": ""pna"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1286, ""end"": 1289, ""text"": ""pna"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2097, ""end"": 2106, ""text"": ""tachypnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2116, ""end"": 2124, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,Respiratory,"{""choices"": [""Bile duct"", ""Urosepsis""]}",4,565,2023-05-08T11:20:08.873650Z,2023-05-08T11:20:08.873688Z,93.586

home admitted for [**month/year (2) 8974**] sepsis from a prevertebral abscess s/p anterior discetomy with a hospital course complicated by pseudomonal pneumonia, multiple intubations, and 40+ day micu stay. . active issues: . # [**month/year (2) 8974**] sepsis from prevertebral abscess s/p anterior cervical diskectomy: patient was found to have blood cultures positive for [**month/year (2) 8974**] on [**3-22**] so she was initially started on daptomycin due to potential allergy to vancomycin but then switched to nafcillin, cefepime, and flagyl for broad coverage. source was felt to be prevertebral fluid collection noted on ct of the neck on [**3-23**]. she triggered on the floor for hypotension with sbp 80 which was initially fluid responsive but eventually persisted despite boluses so she was transferred to the icu for further management. after discussion between ent, ortho spine, and neurosurgery, the patient went for anterior neck exploration by ent and ortho spine and anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion was performed at c5-6 and c6-7 along with incision and drainage of prevertebral abscess on [**3-25**]. patient remained intubated post-procedure due to significant procedure-related edema and her antibiotics were narrowed to nafcillin single-[**doctor last name 360**] therapy. patient's blood pressures were persistently low and she remained pressor dependent until [**2116-4-7**], when she was extubated. due to patient's persistent hypotension despite resolution of bacteremia and drainage of abscess, studies were undertaken to evaluate for other potential sources of infection and she was broadened to dapto/meropenem. u/s of the fistula showed no signs of thrombus, tte showed no vegetations, and ct abdomen/pelvis showed no abscesses or other acute infectious process. despite persistent hypotension and elevated lactate, patient remained arousable and consistently able to follow commands. after 5 days of dapto/[**last name (un) **] her antibiotics were changed to nafcillin monotherapy due to improving bp, absence of a 2nd infectious source and decreasing pressor requirement. however, she developed a cholestatic hepatitis and her nafcillin was switched back to daptomycin. id then recommended transitioning daptomycin to cefazolin. the pt has a documented cefazolin allergy, so desensitization was undertaken but the patient developed anaphylaxis (see below). she was planned to have a 8 week total course (last day = [**5-19**]) of daptomycin for her abscess and will follow up with ortho spine and id for ongoing management. her surgical wound had intermittent trace bleeding, though her hct remained stable and her incision appeared well healing at the time of discharge. . #cefazolin desensitization/anaphylaxis: patient developed cholestatic hepatitis thought to be secondary to nafcillin therapy prompting switch to daptomycin to cover [**month/year (2) 8974**] sepsis. patient had documented cefazolin allergy and desensitization protocol was attempted which she tolerated initially but she then developed anaphylaxis to 1mg of cefazolin characterized by wheezing, sob, tripoding, stridor and received epinephrine, hydrocortisone, benadryl and ranitidine with resolution of her symptoms without recrudescence of symptoms in 48 hours. . # pseudomonal pneumonia c/b respiratory failure and sepsis: pt became stridorous in the setting of a retropharyngeal abscess and was intubated on [**2116-3-24**] for airway protection. she required massive fluid recussitation for sepsis and developed pulmonary edema, which may also have contributed to her failure. she also has underlying copd, which was a likely contributing factor to her poor pulmonary substrate and respiratory failure. her abscess was evacuated and she had acdf of c5-c6 and c6-c7 with ortho spine. she remained intubated due to concern for airway edema until [**2116-4-7**], when she was extubated without event. she then developed fevers, relative hypotension, and respiratory distress with sputum cultures growing pseudomonas. she ultimately required a second intubation and pressors for a priod of time. she was treated with a course of meropenem and amikacin per id recommendation and improved. she was extubated without further significant issues and weaned off pressors for >2 weeks prior to discharge. she was satting well on nasal cannula, afebrile, and without respiratory distress at the time of discharge. . # cholestatic hepatitis: patient's direct bilirubin and transaminases started to acutely rise on [**3-27**]. on exam, patient was also noted to have increased distention and tenderness. u/s of the gallbladder and ct of the abdomen showed only cirrhosis and no acute pathology. cefepime was discontinued due to concern for liver toxicity. etiology was initially thought to be due to acute hepatic decompensation in the setting of critical illness. her lfts remained persistently elevated, and acutely worsened with initiation of nafcillin therapy, which was subsequently discontinued (see above). her hepatitis was felt to be [**3-5**] medication effect, though would note that she has underlying hcv. hbv serologies were negative. . # multifactorial anemia: likely anemia of chronic disease and anemia of esrd. she required intermittent blood transfusions throughout her course, though had no evidence of active bleeding. stool guiac was repeatedly negative. she should continue receiving epo with hd per renal. . # ileus: in the setting of her acute illness and opiate use for pain control, ms [**known lastname 11182**] developed an ileus. for this she received naloxone x1 as well as an aggressive bowel regemin. her ileus was intermittent and resolved; at the time of discharge she was tolerating her tube feeds and a po diet of clear liquids. . # hypotension: ms [**known lastname 11182**] was intermittently hypotensive and requiring pressors throughout her course. initially, her hypotension was almost certainly due to sepsis, which was treated with appropriate antibiotics. later in her course she continued to require pressors with hd and her midodrine was increased to 15mg tid. she was also started on high dose thiamine due to concern for dry beri-beri, with marked improvement in her bps. . # picc associated rue dvt: given her heparin allergy, ms [**known lastname **] was started on an argatroban gtt for her dvt after her picc was removed. hematology was consulted and recommended an argatroban normogram, which was continued for the duration of her micu stay. . # hiv versus critical illness neuropathy: given her multiple medical problems, poor nutrition, prolonged hospital course and peipheral neuropathy, there was concern for dry beri-beri. for this she was started on high dose thiamine with initial improvement in her neuropathy. however, her neuropathy subsequently returned and neurology was consulted who felt it may be consistent with critical illness polysneuropathy. her primary team felt her symptoms were likely related to her chronic hiv. she was trialed on low dose gabapentin but intermittently appeared sedated so that medication was discontinued. . chronic issues: . # hiv ([**2-13**] cd4 375): her home haart regemin was continued throughout her course. viral load early on in her admission was 183. . # lip/copd/asthma: her home albuterol/ipratroprium were continued throughout her course. at the time of discharge, she was breathing comfortably on nasal cannula. . # pulm htn: her sildenafil 50mg po tid was initially held for hypotension, but was restarted once she was off pressors. . # esrd: started on cvvh while on pressor support. she had a l subclavian temp hd line placed and received intermittent cvvh until weaned off pressors. her temp hd line was pulled on [**2116-4-7**] she thereafter she received intermitted hd through her fistula in order to take off acumulated volume. she was transistioned to t/th/sat schedule prior to discharge. . # chronic thrombocytopenia: ms [**known lastname 11182**] is chronically thrombocytopenic, though her platelet counts on this admission were markedly lower. her chronic

 56yom with h/o esld caused by hep c and etoh cirrhosis who lives at [**last name (un) 4367**] [**hospital3 **] who was found down, being transferred to the micu for hypotension.

Brief Hospital Course:
 [**known firstname **] [**known lastname **] is a 56-year-old male with history of chronic hepatitis c as well as alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, previous variceal bleeds, status post tips procedure, who was admitted to the micu for ams, hypotension, and fevers and who passed away on hospital day 2. . # shock: etiology was uncertain even at the time of death although looked most likely to be septic shock given high fevers and white count. however no clear infectious source was identified. he received broad empiric coverage with vanc, cefepime, and azithromycin. toxic ingestion such as amphetamine overdose or serotonin syndrome was also on the differential because he had fever, ams, and rhabdo, however it was unclear why he would have had hypotension if that was the explanation. amphetamine overdose and seratonin syndrome were considered because he was prescribed adderall and multiple seratonergic medications. however according to his alf he was actively abusing drugs in addition to adderall and therefore he could have had almost any toxidrome. a cardiac component to his shock was initially considered as he had elevated troponins and ck-mb however cardiac output was [**9-6**] as measured by nicom. scv02 was high. pe was considered as a possibility as tte showed rv dysfunction and worsened pulm htn, but he had rv dysfunction in the past. bilateral lenis were negative for dvt. he was not stable enough for cta or v/q scan and was unlikely to be able to tolerate anticoagulation given he was also in dic with active bleeding. . the patient was severely ill on arrival to the micu and continued to rapidly deteriorate despite aggressive resuscitation efforts. his blood pressure was not able to be maintained despite fluids and multiple pressors. lactic acid was high on presentation and continued to rise up to 16. he had respiratory failure requiring intubation. his laboratory findings were suggestive of dic and he required cryo, ffp, and blood transfusion. during the hospitalization he developed bleeding from the rectum, bladder, and mucous membranes. he had severe acute kidney injury and associated electrolyte derangements. he also had evidence of shock liver. rhabdomyolysis was presents as well which could be explained by toxidrome but unusual for septic shock. . despite aggressive resuscitation efforts the patient continued to decline. after discussion with the patient's son [**name (ni) 382**] and also his brothers it was determined that the patient would not want prolonged intubation or resuscitation if he had a small chance of returning to his previous level of functioning. a decision was made to make the patient cmo and take the patient off of the ventilator. he passed away shortly thereafter. . # respiratory failure/hypoxia: most likely this was ards from shock. ct chest showed some small peripheral wedge-shaped infiltrates, which could have been infarcts. he was not stable enough for vq scan or cta. . #altered mental status: infection (cns vs. pulmonary) vs. encephalopathy vs. toxic ingestion.  has tox screen positive for amphetamines/opioids, however he was on adderall and opioids at home. nchct did not show any acute process.  neurology was consulted and recommended mri although patient was never clinically stable enough to be taken for mri. . #

 the patient arrived from outside hospital in extremis. of his many problems, the following were prioritized, given his overall poor condition: for the patient's respiratory failure, he arrived intubated and his ventilation was continued mechanically with no attempts to wean. his primary issues appeared to be secondary to a possible colchicine overdose and/or sepsis. the patient had a known suicide attempt five days before presentation. according to the patient's girlfriend, in addition to aripiprazole and clonazepam, he took whatever was left of his colchicine prescription. colchicine toxicity manifests as gastroenteritis, pancytopenias, cardiac abnormalities, and various other issues. by the point of his admission to [**hospital1 18**], the colchicine would have been widely distributed to his organ systems. in addition, the patient could have been septic. it was not clear what the patient's source of infection is, though he had several possible sites. his open right knee wound is possible and could be polymicrobial if infected. he had been treated with antibiotics for osteomyelitis in the past, but was seen by orthopedics who did not feel that that the open area on knee was the source of infection. there was no purulence or fluctuance. given the strong possibility of colchicine overdose, bacteremia from translocation across the damaged gi mucosa was also a possibility. his chest films were not suggestive of pneumonia, but per preliminary radiology read, it could not be ruled out.  the patient was started on vancomycin, metronidazole, and meropenem to cover broad array of possible organisms from either wound, pulmonary, or gut source.       once the patient arrived to [**hospital1 18**], he almost immediately became hemodynamically unstable. the patient was bradycardic into the 20s without consistent femoral pulse. epinephrine was provided, which brought him out of the bradycardia. the antibiotics were quickly loaded via iv. abgs showed a substantial acidosis, for which some bicarbonate was given as a temporizing measure. the leading diagnoses continued to be either colchicine overdose or sepsis. the patient's ex-wife and his girlfriend were both notified of his poor condition, but were informed that we would try dialysis as a last-ditch measure. before a dialysis catheter could be placed, the patient's blood pressure began to drop and was unresponsive to fluids. pressors were started and the patient needed three pressors to keep his systolic blood pressure above 80. he continued to be oliguric; as he was sedated, mental status could not be appreciated. cvvh was instituted following the placement of a femoral dialysis catheter, though cvvh would likely not clear colchicine, if that was the source of his shock. several hours of cvvh did not help the patient in any appreciable way. during this resuscitation phase, the patient's pupils were seen to be dilated and non-responsive to light. he was too unstable to undergo head ct.  he continued to show acidosis on his abgs; the patient would have episodes of bradycardia that would respond to an amp of bicarbonate but then quickly return. at this point, the patient's next of [**doctor first name **] was then notified again and made aware that it would be unlikely that he would have any recovery. the decision was then made to remove pressors and stop using bicarbonate therapy. the patient died shortly thereafter.",592,"[{""start"": 590, ""end"": 599, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 646, ""end"": 653, ""text"": ""abdomen"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 879, ""end"": 884, ""text"": ""stool"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 624, ""end"": 632, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2794, ""end"": 2800, ""text"": ""gastro"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 1821, ""end"": 1826, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3459, ""end"": 3463, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3565, ""end"": 3569, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 1393, ""end"": 1400, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1961, ""end"": 1972, ""text"": ""hemodynamic"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 3926, ""end"": 3937, ""text"": ""hemodynamic"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 4485, ""end"": 4493, ""text"": ""catheter"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 4846, ""end"": 4854, ""text"": ""catheter"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 4485, ""end"": 4489, ""text"": ""cath"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 4846, ""end"": 4850, ""text"": ""cath"", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 2826, ""end"": 2833, ""text"": ""cardiac"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1756, ""end"": 1762, ""text"": ""cardio"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3577, ""end"": 3582, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3167, ""end"": 3172, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3810, ""end"": 3815, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1119, ""end"": 1123, ""text"": ""knee"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3162, ""end"": 3166, ""text"": ""knee"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3162, ""end"": 3166, ""text"": ""knee"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 3365, ""end"": 3369, ""text"": ""knee"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 323, ""end"": 334, ""text"": ""debridement"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3266, ""end"": 3271, ""text"": ""osteo"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 3167, ""end"": 3172, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 3810, ""end"": 3815, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 1119, ""end"": 1123, ""text"": ""knee"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 3365, ""end"": 3369, ""text"": ""knee"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 18, ""end"": 29, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2341, ""end"": 2352, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3612, ""end"": 3621, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3817, ""end"": 3826, ""text"": ""pulmonary"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1017, ""end"": 1022, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1304, ""end"": 1314, ""text"": ""tachypneic"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1540, ""end"": 1548, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2373, ""end"": 2381, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Abdominal"", ""Skin and soft tissue"", ""Respiratory""]}",Urosepsis,4,551,2023-05-08T11:03:46.143475Z,2023-05-08T11:03:46.143503Z,176.891

Brief Hospital Course:
 64 yo f with hepatitis c cirrhosis who was admitted to osh on [**5-24**] for hepatic encephalopathy and failure to thrive and transferred here on [**6-15**] to the hepatorenal service for further mgmt. pt was noted to have r hydrothorax which was tapped for 1.5 liters. she was also found to have an enterococcal uti for which she was treated with ampicillin/vancomycin. she was starting to develop a hepatorenal picture on her first several days on the floor, was aggressively diuresed with an increase in creatinine and oliguria, then became anuric. she was then given a fluid challenge with albumin and subsequently developed pulmonary edema on the l side, requiring nrb. she was transferred to the micu on [**6-20**] and was intubated and started on cvvh. her r pleural effusion was tapped in the micu; dr. [**last name (stitle) 497**] did not wish to have a pigtail catheter. she had a total of 72 hrs of cvvh. during cvvh, she was hypotensive, initially felt to be hypovolemic (intravascularly depleted) and possibly septic and her abx was broadened from ampicillin to cover enterococci uti to vanc/cefepime though all other culture data was negative. pt did not have enough ascites to tap. she was then noted to have failed her [**last name (un) 104**] stim (she was previously on prednisone for copd flare at osh) and was started on stress dose steroids. this was tapered to 10 mg po prednisone on [**7-2**]. on she is now normotensive with sbp in 120s back on her home bisoprolol, which has been titrated up. uop has also returned and she was restarted on lasix/aldactone. she was stable enough to transfer back to the hepatorenal floor service by [**2195-7-3**] where she was stable but with guarded status given her hepatorenal syndrome. her issues are summarized by issue below: . # hepatorenal syndrome: pt came in w/cr of 1.2. and was rapidly climbing. urine studies were c/w hrs type/prerenal over atn. pt was anuric after uf on [**6-20**]; uop has returned. off cvvh since friday [**6-26**], hd line dc'd [**6-12**]. however, the patient's cr remained at 1.9 which had been trending upwards. uop slowing down on the floor, so on [**2195-7-3**] she was started mitodrine 5mg tid, octreotide 100mg sc tid. renal was involved regarding management of her fluid status as we would prefer to remove fluid by hd to protect kidneys than give fluid by albumin as pt had fluid overload, resp distress last time. the family is aware that her status is guarded and after many discussions, the decision was made to discharge her to home with hospice. . # hypotension/sepsis: initially thought to be likely multifactorial with the main component being recent thoracentesis and then hd session with removal of 2l of uf. there was mild response from sbp of low 80s to high 80s after 500 cc bolus of ivfs and 1 unit of prbcs. however, map began to drift below 60 in am of [**6-21**] and pt was started on levophed. bp also began to fall after intubation, may be due to meds v. positive pressure ventilation (however, higher peep seems to be improving aeration of r lung). pt is less likely to be septic given hr, lack of fever, lack of leukocytosis though pt began to deteriorate after switching from vanc to amp. the patient's antibiotic coverage was broadened in the icu to cefepime/vanc as pt began to deteriorate after switching from vanc to amp for enterococcal uti-treat for a two week course ending on [**7-6**]. adrenal insufficiency now considered to be primary cause. by the time she was transferred from the icu, she was off all pressors, and antibiotic coverage for sepsis. her bp ran high so she was restarted on bisoprolol 10mg daily which was discontinued on [**2195-7-3**] as her bp was starting to trend downwards. the patient was also restarted on midodrine and octreotide to maintain her bp. . # s/p hypoxic respiratory failure in the icu: this is likely due to pulm edema after fluid resuscitation in the setting of r hydrothorax and anuria, also mental status. per liver, no pigtail catheter as patient was still being considered for liver transplant. she was successfully extubated on [**6-29**], satting well on room air. on the floor after transfer from the icu, the patient's respiratory status has been stable. . # adrenal insufficiency- the patient had an abnormal [**last name (un) 104**] stim test while septic, so given stress dose steroids and quickly tapered off steroids by [**2195-7-4**]. her blood pressure remained stable off the steroids. . #hypernatremia-likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion. the patient's tube feeds were adjusted to correct for hypernatremia. . #hyperglycemia: likely exacerbated by stress dose steroids and tpn. the patient's lantus was uptitrated given the patient's hyperglycemia. . #

 hemodialysis line not working

History of Present Illness:
 50 year old man with history of end stage renal disease secondary to amyloidosis, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes on insulin admitted after his hemodialysis line was found to be not working halfway through his hemodialysis session today.  because of his history of hyperkalemia, it was not felt to be safe to return him to his nursing home without access.  he has been admitted to the hospital for monitoring and for resolution of his access problem.

Brief Hospital Course:
 50 year old man with history of end stage renal disease secondary to amyloidosis, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes on insulin admitted for dysfunction of hemodialysis line, transferred to icu for hypotension after hemodialysis (3kg taken off) and fentanyl during interventional radiology procedure to declot and replace hemodialysis line. . # end stage renal disease: - last hemodialysis [**6-14**], right femoral tunneled catheter functioning well - renal to attempt to clear catheter with local tpa failed -> interventional radiology for catheter change [**5-30**] -> hypotension, extensive clot burden in right femoral vein through inferior vena cava up to right atrium -> icu [**date range (1) 22380**] - dialysis catheter tip growing e. coli, sensitive to ceftazidime, received 1g qhd for 2 weeks after catheter removed, last dose given in in dialysis [**6-14**] - right groin catheter in place functioning for now - sevelamer, cinacalcet, nephrocaps - family meeting [**6-6**], decided on placement of peritoneal dialysis and placement of patient in facility that could perform peritoneal dialysis. - status post peritoneal dialysis catheter placement [**6-10**], needs 2-3 weeks to heal prior to use, renal doctor [**first name (titles) **] [**last name (titles) 11197**] as outpatient. . # finger ischemia: consistent with history of extensive microvascular disease. no anticoagulation - see rationale below. - status post plastic surgery consult - appreciate input - no surgery for now, awaiting demarcation, finger segment will likely autoamputate.  no signs of infection necessitating amputation during this hospitalization. . # thrombosis: - extensive inferior vena cava burden to level of right atrium and likely involvement of superior vena cava. risk associated with anticoagulation in this patient related to history of hemodynamically signficant epistaxis, recurrent epistaxis, and hemoptysis related to fungal lesion in left upper lobed of the lung. - maintained active type and screen in blood bank - heparin gtt was started after extensive clot discovered, stopped given epistaxis, possible hemoptysis vs. swallowed blood, peri-catheter oozing [**6-6**].  patient hemodynamically stable. hematocrit 34.9->36.7 (dialysis in between draws).  will not anticoagulate now after discussing risks and benefits in family meeting on [**6-6**]. . # leukocytosis: - no fevers and no signs or symptoms to suggest infection. - wbc 12.8 early in hospital course, now no elevation in wbc - treated for e. coli sepsis after grew on hd cath tip with ceftazidime as above - blood cultures 4/30 - no growth (final) - blood cultures 5/10, [**6-12**] pending - were drawn after mildly hypotensive following dialysis, had no fever/wbc elevation . # hypotension & tachycardia: most likely due to fluid removal from dialysis + fentanyl. sepsis also in ddx, especially with leukocytosis.  considered bleeding while on heparin gtt, adrenal insufficiency given chronic steroids for sarcoidosis. - hemodialysis end goal weight increased - blood cultures 4/30 - no growth (final) - triggered [**6-1**] for bp 60/doppler -> 80s systolic after 1.5l, no signs of active bleeding, mentating at baseline, hematocrit stable - morphine discontinued as likely contributed to hypotension - now oxycodone for finger pain - still mildly hypotenisve post-hemodialysis, asymptomatic, pressure responds to iv fluids . # sarcoidosis: - on chronic prednisone . # pulmonary aspergillosis: - on chronic suppressive voriconazole . # h/o mrsa bacteremia: - no evidence of active infection - continue ds bactrim x 4 with hd for suppressive therapy - followed by [**first name4 (namepattern1) **] [**last name (namepattern1) 7443**] as outpatient . # paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: - metoprolol 12.5 mg po 2x/day for rate control as outpatient, had been held in setting of hypotension -> restarted [**6-1**] am (held for systolic < 100) - initially no anticoagulation given history of bleeds -> started heparin gtt with discovery of extensive thrombosis -> heparin discontinued [**6-6**] given mild nosebleed/hemoptysis/ooze from femoral catheter . # type 2 diabetes - continued glargine at 8 units hs with ssi - fingersticks good range when eating, hypoglycemic when npo for catheter placement . # possible asthma: on albuterol prn . # recent nosebleeds: - per ent consult on last admission, humidified air as much as possible, nasal saline spray q2h, bacitracin to each nostril and massage gently for a few seconds qam and qhs. - epistaxis precautions, including no straining, nose blowing, or temperature hot foods. light activity only. colace or other stool softener on a regular basis. . # constipation: standing colace, senna, dulcolax (made standing [**6-6**]); prn lactulose added [**6-6**] -> had bowel movement . # gerd: ppi . # fen: renal, diabetic, low potassium diet . # ppx: ppi, bowel regimen, held anticoagulation . # code:

 shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
 mr. [**known lastname 99948**] is a 62 year-old man with esophageal cancer with mets to lung and brain, s/p several rounds of [**last name (lf) 3454**], [**first name3 (lf) **] and whole chest xrt, who presents from [**hospital **] hospital with one day of shortness of breath.  about one week ago, he was diagnosed by his oncologist with pneumonia after several days of productive cough and was started on levofloxacin and flagyl. two days prior to admission, he was admitted overnight to [**hospital 47**] hospital for altered mental status [**3-19**] hypoglycemia. he was feeling better from a respiratory standpoint when he was discharged on the day prior to admission.  this morning, the patient felt more sob.  he normally uses o2 at home, 3l with exertion, but found himself needing up to 5l at home today even at rest.  has a cough but no sputum production.  denies fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or weakness.  his wife called 911 and he was brought back to [**hospital 47**] hospital ed.  there he was noted to have a low-grade temp to 100.3 and hypoxic to mid-80s on a nrb.  the patient requested transfer to [**hospital1 18**] for further management. . in the ed, initial vs were: t 99.1, p 133, bp 106/72, r 24, o2 sat 91% on nrb.  he was notably sob but speaking in full sentences.  he was hypoxic to the mid-80s to low 90s on nrb.  he was given a combivent neb, however became more hypoxic (to low 80s) and tachycardic (to 130s) with this and so it was stopped. cxr showed a rll opacity.  he was given vanco and cefepime for empiric pna coverage.  he was also started on a heparin gtt and given ivf. . on the floor, he reports that his breathing feels much better. he has no other complaints currently except that he is hungry and thirsty.

Brief Hospital Course:
 [**hospital 153**] hospital course: . #  shortness of breath/hypoxia:  upon admission, the patient was in acute hypoxic distress requiring almost 100% fio2 high flow oxygen.  his acute decompensation was most likely secondary to pneumonia compounded by metastatic esophageal disease.  pe was thought to be less likely despite the positive history of pe and malignancy, especially as the patient was on prophylaxtic lovenox at home.  dopplers of the lower extremities were negative for dvt.  a tte with bubble study showed no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  upon admission, the patient was started on empiric antibiotic course of vancomycin and cefepime for hcap. tobramycin was added for double coverage after blood cx from the emergency department grew gnr, but was discontinued once sensitivities were back.  additionally, the patient received albuterol and atrovent inhalers prn, was gently diuresed with lasix, and was encouraged to ambulate/ use incentive spirometry to prevent atelectasis.  despite completing an 8 day course of vancomycin and a (14) day course of ceftazadime (switch from cefepime on day 10 of therapy due to new susceptibility report of gnr), the patient's respiratory status did not improve significantly.  a thoracic ct w/o contrast confirmed diffuse metastatic disease compressing the bronchioles and the patient's respiratory compromise was largely irreversible.  prior to transfer from the icu, the patient was referred to palliative care (see below).  at time of discharge from icu the patient was stable on high flow oxygen with 60% fio2 and 6lnc. . #  fever/leukocytosis:  the patient's initial sepsis was attributed to bacterial pneumonia based on cxr and symptoms. the patient was empirically started on vancomycin and cefepime for hap.  urine culture was negative.  blood cultures from the ed grew gnr so tobramycin was added for double coverage.  this was discontinued after 2 days once antibiotic sensitivities returned.  the patient completed an 8 day course of vancomycin. on day 10, cefepime was switched to ceftazadime based on new antibiotic sensitivity profile from the patient's initial positive blood culture.  over icu course the patient defervesed and his wbc count returned to [**location 213**].  unfortunately his respiratory status did not greatly improve (see above). . #  esophageal cancer with cns and lung metastases:  the patient's primary oncologist, dr. [**last name (stitle) 99949**] was notified of the patient's admission and progress throughout his stay in the icu. the patient was continued on chronic dose of prednisone as per neurooncologist due to symptoms of mild adrenal insuffieciency. when it was determined that metastatic disease contributed to respiratory decline, primary oncologist was involved with discussion with patient regarding his poor prognosis.  the patient has decided to receive palliative care at home following this hospitalization. . #  diabetes type ii: stable with humalog sliding scale . # fen: encouraged increased po intake with dietary supplementations.  electrolytes were monitored serially and repleted as needed. . # prophylaxis: the patient rmained on outpatient lovenox for dvt prophylaxis and ppi for stress ulcer prophylaxis.  the patient also remained on outpatient dapsone for pcp prophylaxis in the setting of chronic prednisone use . #code: dnr/dni confirmed with patient . [**hospital 2035**] hospital course: ct scan on admission demonstrated significant progression of metastatic melanoma. patient and family meet with palliative care and decision was to discharge home with hospice. oxygen was titrated to comfort (not oxygen sat) based on goals of care. patient started on morphine sl to improve dyspnea and cough in additon to dexamethasone, albuterol nabs, lasix and cough syrup. patient was discharged on 3 more days of iv abx keftaz to treat bactermia for 14 day course however hospice was not able to provide iv therapy therefore abx was discontinued.",583,"[{""start"": 967, ""end"": 975, ""text"": ""diarrhea"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2997, ""end"": 3001, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3625, ""end"": 3630, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2393, ""end"": 2400, ""text"": ""cardiac"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 255, ""end"": 260, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 5062, ""end"": 5067, ""text"": ""ulcer"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 4444, ""end"": 4449, ""text"": ""neuro"", ""labels"": [""Neurological""]}, {""start"": 165, ""end"": 170, ""text"": ""brain"", ""labels"": [""Neurological""]}, {""start"": 665, ""end"": 676, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3034, ""end"": 3045, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3195, ""end"": 3206, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 4117, ""end"": 4128, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 4570, ""end"": 4581, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 407, ""end"": 416, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2080, ""end"": 2089, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3515, ""end"": 3524, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3165, ""end"": 3171, ""text"": ""bronch"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 450, ""end"": 455, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 902, ""end"": 907, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 5572, ""end"": 5577, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 5633, ""end"": 5638, ""text"": ""cough"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 18, ""end"": 37, ""text"": ""shortness of breath"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 325, ""end"": 344, ""text"": ""shortness of breath"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1892, ""end"": 1911, ""text"": ""shortness of breath"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1619, ""end"": 1622, ""text"": ""pna"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 156, ""end"": 160, ""text"": ""lung"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 4209, ""end"": 4213, ""text"": ""lung"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 5560, ""end"": 5567, ""text"": ""dyspnea"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1330, ""end"": 1335, ""text"": "" sob "", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,Respiratory,"{""choices"": [""Bile duct"", ""Endocarditis"", ""Neurological""]}",4,542,2023-05-08T10:51:27.412008Z,2023-05-08T10:51:27.412047Z,60.798

Brief Hospital Course:
 68m with h/o esrd, indwelling foley catheter, recent type b aortic dissection and multiple [**month/day (4) 1106**] procedures, who presented with fever and hypotension. . # fever: on augmentin prior to admission. several infectious sources were investigated but no positive cultures or focal clinical signs/symptoms of infection were identified. bcx, ucx and cxr were negative. he was at risk for uti [**2-10**] indwelling foleyg. iven prolonged exposure to hospital setting, he received a 5-day course of vanc/zosyn. fever trended down overall. he did continue to have low-grade temps of 99-100 for 3 days prior to discharge, but this was felt to be due to drug rash with eosinophilia plus and possible contribution from known left ij dvt. repeat urinalysis performed prior to discharge was clean. . # hypotension: patient was hypotensive on admission, so all bp meds were help and ivf were administer. he also received antibiotics as above (vanc/zosyn x5d) for possible sepsis of unclear source. overdialysis was another possibility, as was hypotension as a systemic symptom of plavix drug rash (see below). he was normotensive for several days off home antihypertensives and again after restarted reduced-dose metoprolol as discussed below. . # lij dvt seen on lue doppler us [**2-8**] obtained for new tense l arm edema. considered provoked given lij hd line. line out. clinically resolving after starting heparin bridge to coumadin. at time of discharge, inr 2.9 (goal [**2-11**]) so heparin was discontinued. [**hospital 197**] clinic f/u w/pcp [**name initial (pre) 13303**]. will need closeinr monitoring over the next week. plan for 3-6 months anticoagulation. . # drug rash to plavix mildly erythrodermic on admission but ongoing for weeks and not bothersome to pt. question of dress given mild transaminitis (new v old?), eosinophilia, and fever; derm c/s thought no given unclear chronicity of transaminitis. dc'd plavix (vasc [**first name9 (namepattern2) **] [**doctor last name **] was aware and agreed given patient to be anticoagulated on heparin bridge to coumadin). eosinophilia trended down (24%->15%) & rash began to improve off plavix - decreased erythema, increasing scaling of affected skin. needed topical steroid [**hospital1 **] and petrolatum liberally applied 2-3x daily for skin protection as he heals. . # s/p aaa repair pt has multiple grafts, including r axillobifemoral bypass, thoracic aortic stent graft in the proximal descending aorta. [**hospital1 **] surgery followed closely, and recommended f/u as arranged. dc'd plavix in setting of drug rash; plan for continued anticoagulation w/ coumadin (for dvt). neurology consult recs starting aspirin once off coumadin in [**3-15**] mos. continued simvastatin. . # fecal incontinence, urinary retention, decreased rectal tone, weakness chronic since aaa dissection in [**2106-12-9**]. ddx included nerve injury in the setting of aortic bypass graft; or anterior spinal ischemia. patient also suffers le weakness, thus has been bedbound for the most part over ~1 mo. mr l/t spine showed patchy infarcts in lumbar spinal cord, but preserved sensation in perineum suggests primary urologic problem also contributing. ongoing hope for trial of foley removal/spontaneous urination (deferred by pt during this admit). urology consult for urodynamic studies arranged for outpatient f/u. . #hx hypertension initially held home bp meds in setting of hypotension, including metoprolol 125mg po tid, amlodipine 10mg po daily, clonidine 0.1mg po bid, hydralazine 50mg po tid. bp normalized, then increased to 140s-160s, at which time metoprolol was restarted at reduced dose of 50 mg tid; sbp ranged 110-130 thereafter. . # normocytic anemia: patient presented with anemia similar to prior admissions, with hct in the mid-to-low 20s. thought to be [**2-10**] to esrd but, as this has only been chronic for ~1 month, bleeding was also considered. guaiac negative. he does have a hematoma at site of recent femoral bypass, which improved throughout admission. it was difficult to assess iron studies in the setting of other inflammation (dvt, possible infection); should be repeated as an outpatient. . # resolution of renal failure on dialysis at time of admission; underlying problem was likely renal ischemia during aaa dissection 1 month ago. renal function improved to cr 1.8 during this admission. no further dialysis was deemed necessary so his hd line was removed. . transitional issues 1. hypertension. monitor bps, restart previous bp meds prn 2. recent renal failure. monitor cr. 3. drug rash - monitor for symptomatic improvement, trend eos. 4. low-grade temps. expect resolution as dvt resorbed/drug rash resolves. monitor. fever >101 would be a change from baseline. 5. foley catheter dependence - needs frequent trials of foley removal & urodynamic studies. 6. monitor inr for coumadin dosing (pcp to manage). 7. start daily aspirin once coumadin eventually dc'd.",582,"[{""start"": 1854, ""end"": 1863, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]},

Brief Hospital Course:
 mrs. [**known lastname 75204**] is [**age over 90 **] y.o. female without clear cognitive impairment, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic colitis who presented with with abdominal pain and hypotension. . on arrival to the [**hospital1 18**] er, her vs were t 34.7 rectal (93.4f), bp 96/66, hr 69, rr 26 and sats 100% on nrb. given her abdominal pain and h/o ischemic colitis, there was concern for an intraabdominal process. initial labs revealed worsening renal function, a bicarb of 9, and a lactate of 4.0. she was given flagyl and levaquin iv, with plans to perform an abdomen and pelvis ct. interpreters were called in order to communicate with the patient and the patient refused surgery if that was what would be needed. after lengthy discussions with the patient, her family, and the interpreters, the conclusion was that there would be no imaging as the patient would not pursue surgical intervention if an abnormality was found. given that she was a known dnr/dni, the decision was made to not put a cvl in and she would be treated with ivf, iv antibiotics and pain medication as needed. in the er, her bp ranged from 72-123/39-99, hr 58-67, and o2 sats 96-100% on 2l nc. it was noted that the interpreter was called repeatedly for ? of agitation, restlessness and pain (mostly in her legs). in total, she received 100mcg iv fentanyl and 16mg iv morphine between 1800 and 2100. she was then transferred to the floor to be [**hospital1 3225**]. . however, on arrival to the floor, the patient's family inquired about antibiotics and goals of care were readdressed. it was then felt that the patient was not truly [**hospital1 3225**], but that she would want care up to the point of cpr and intubation. in the midst of this conversation, she became somnolent and unresponsive to sternal rub. her o2 sats dropped down to 76% on 10l and she was placed on a nrb. her hr was noted to be down in the 30s and her temperature was 92. she was given 1l ns bolus and a total of 0.6mg narcan with minimal improvement. decision was made to transfer her to the icu for further care. . in the icu, she continued to decline. it was felt that her hypotension was likely due to sepsis, probably from her uti but an abdominal source could not be excluded. her antibiotics were thus broadened to meropenem, ciprofloxacin, linezolid and flagyl (to double-cover for gnr and to cover for both mrsa and vre - she had positive swabs for both in the past). she was given ivf (with bicarbonate, given her low bicarbonate on labs) to attempt to maintain a sbp >90 or a map >60. however, given her dni status, fluid resuscitation was limited by her respiratory status. she was warmed with a bairhugger and was also started on steroids for presumed adrenal insufficiency from sepsis. she was also found to be bradycardic, which was concerning. her calcium was repleted and we attempted to improve her bicarbonate by supplementing her ivf with bicarbonate. glucagon was considered, given that the patient is on lopressor and cardizem at home, but it was felt to be less likely due to her medications given that she had not yet received her medications today. repeat lab tests revealed an inr of 22.8 and showed that the patient was in worsening renal failure. . a discussion was held with the family ([**first name9 (namepattern2) 22858**] [**doctor first name **]) in the icu regarding the patient's poor prognosis. she understood the patient's grave state, but wanted to continue antibiotics and ivf resuscitation. the patient remained a dnr/dni. the patient's status continued to decline overnight. she became persistently hypotensive despite multiple ivf boluses. her granddaughter [**name (ni) **] was notified of her worsening status. the patient's oxygen saturations then began to drop, she remained somnolent, and her bradycardia progressed to asystole. she expired at 5:25am on [**2123-8-11**]. her granddaughter was notified and refused an autopsy. given that the patient was in the hospital less then 24 hours, the medical examiner was also notified and refused the case. .",581,"[{""start"": 18, ""end"": 27, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 320, ""end"": 329, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 2400, ""end"": 2409, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 2565, ""end"": 2574, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 2636, ""end"": 2645, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 4437, ""end"": 4446, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 1586, ""end"": 1593, ""text"": ""abdomen"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 2803, ""end"": 2810, ""text"": ""abdomen"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 197, ""end"": 204, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2368, ""end"": 2375, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 2597, ""end"": 2604, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 349, ""end"": 357, ""text"": ""appetite"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 197, ""end"": 204, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2368, ""end"": 2375, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2597, ""end"": 2604, ""text"": ""colitis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2686, ""end"": 2693, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 5453, ""end"": 5460, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 4425, ""end"": 4429, ""text"": "" uti"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1210, ""end"": 1216, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 167, ""end"": 173, ""text"": ""atrial"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2334, ""end"": 2340, ""text"": ""atrial"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3525, ""end"": 3528, ""text"": ""leg"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 4860, ""end"": 4871, ""text"": ""respiratory"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3930, ""end"": 3940, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3930, ""end"": 3940, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]","{""choices"": [""Abdominal"", ""Urosepsis""]}",None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Gastrointestinal"", ""Endocarditis"", ""Respiratory""]}",4,540,2023-05-08T10:47:41.498168Z,2023-05-08T10:48:30.069859Z,165.715

Brief Hospital Course:
 88 m nursing home resident, with history of hypertension, lymphedema, depression, was admitted with confusion and hypoxemia, diagnosed with pneumonia, pleural effusions, nstemi, and lymphedema. . # pneumonia: patient had decompensating o2 sat readings after a ct scan (no shortness of breath, no rash, no itching after baracat however), and was intubated secondary to worsening hypoxemia, confusion, refusal to wear the nrb, and difficulty in defending his airway. cxr showed bilateral pleural effusions and possible pneumonia. he completed 10 day courses of levofloxacin and vancomycin, with clinical improvement in sputum production. sputum cultures were negative. on admission, the patient had been hypothermic to 95.7, normotensive, which was concerning for sepsis, but remained normotensive and normothermic for the rest of hospital stay. he required extensive nt suctioning for several days, and his suctioning needs are still every few hours daily. he does not have a clear gag reflex and may be chronically aspirating without proper suctioning. . # pleural effusions: bilateral on cxr, moderate in size, were not tapped since they were attributed to chf and global right heart failure, and would likely be recurrent. tte showed ef 35%, 1+ mr, 1+ tr. . # nstemi: he had an nstemi on arrival, with a decrease in ef after this mi. he has been maintained on asa 81 daily and metoprolol. . # afib: rate control is metoprolol, with hr 80-110, so metoprolol should be titrated up as an outpatient as bp allows. current bp on discharge is 105/55. he was in normal sinus rhythm with frequent apcs on admission, but is currently in afib. he was not cardioverted since he has structural cardiac disease and kept normotension post-nstemi. he is on no rhythm control. anticoagulation should be started at rehab as an outpatient. . # fluid status/lymphedema/pleural effusions: he was diuresed with lasix 20-80 iv prn to length of stay fluid status of -11.2 l. he is being discharged on no lasix, but his fluid status should be closely followed, since he will likely need lasix on a regular basis on his home regimen. . # change in mental status: he was confused on admission, but his mental status has much improved during his hospital stay, and has now returned to baseline per his family. he is able to follow commands, move all extremities, and communicate his wishes. he had a ct head performed initially to assess confusion, but this was negative. there was concern for ttp/hus since he was anemic, thrombocytopenic, febrile, mild renal failure, but there were no schistocytes on peripheral smear, and dic labs were normal. tsh, b12, and folate were normal. . # nutrition: peg tube was placed on [**10-26**]. he was briefly apneic in the setting of peg tube placement, but he recovered with nrb administration. tube feeds should be started at rehab upon arrival. nutrition may advise the type and rate of tube feed, since he was not on tube feeds before admission. speech and swallow assessed him twice, and patient would chew and hold the food in his mouth, but he would not swallow any food or fluids (he would hold the food or fluid in his mouth until it was removed or suctioned out). for this reason, s&s could not assess his ability to swallow, and he was thus kept npo. before his peg tube was placed, he had a dobhoff post-pyloric placed, which the patient pulled out after one day. . # hypertension: well-controlled. he was on nifedipine 60 daily before admission, and is being discharged on metoprolol, which may be titrated up as needed. . # abdominal pain: resolved within the first day of admission after bowel movement. his liver function tests, and pancreatic enzymes were normal. . # diabetes mellitus type 2: he was maintained on insulin sliding scale with good control of glucose. . # hypernatremia: he has a tendency to hypernatremia, with na 145-149. he had been repleted with free water with 1-2 liters of d5w iv daily, but free water boluses of 250 ml q8h may be started in rehab upon discharge. daily monitoring of sodium should be performed until free water daily needs are determined. . # high bicarbonate: patient had elevated bicarbonate levels, maximum of 49. he was treated with diamox for 2 days before admission, which worked well to reduce bicarb to 41 on discharge. diamox may continue to work for him as an outpatient, in case his bicarb increases again on discharge. . # anemia: stable, likely from chronic disease. . # poor physical conditioning: patient should receive vigorous pt/ot at rehab as he is severely deconditioned from his recent clinical state. . # depression: patient has a previous history of depression, and also exhibited signs of depression during his hospital stay. he stated that he did not wish to live any longer. the icu team had multiple family meetings with his two sons, daughter-in-law, aunt, and cousin, regarding goals of care. the family felt very strongly that the patient has been expressing the same sentiment and symptoms of depression for the past few years whenever he is sick, and then changes his sentiment to being glad that he is living when he is well. the patient's wishes were difficult to assess since the patient was delirious for the initial half of his hospital stay, and his mental status only gradually returned day by day. . # for general health care issues/code status: he was kept on pantoprazole, heparin sc, and a bowel regimen of senna, colace. his code status was confirmed with the patient and his family as dnr/dni. for contact information with his son: [**name (ni) **] [**name (ni) **]: [**telephone/fax (3) 12356**].",579,"[{""start"": 4798, ""end"": 4807, ""text"": ""abdominal"", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 787, ""end"": 792, ""text"": "" abd "", ""labels"": [""Abdominal""]}, {""start"": 4863, ""end"": 4868, ""text"": ""bowel"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 6649, ""end"": 6654, ""text"": ""bowel"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 4221, ""end"": 4228, ""text"": ""swallow"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 4321, ""end"": 4328, ""text"": ""swallow"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 4487, ""end"": 4494, ""text"": ""swallow"", ""labels"": [""Gastrointestinal""]}, {""start"": 4883, ""end"": 4888, ""text"": ""liver"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 4477, ""end"": 4481, ""text"": ""bili"", ""labels"": [""Bile duct""]}, {""start"": 3775, ""end"": 3782, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2930, ""end"": 2937, ""text"": ""cardiac"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2425, ""end"": 2430, ""text"": ""heart"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 2893, ""end"": 2899, ""text"": ""cardio"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 153, ""end"": 158, ""text"": ""chest"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 3736, ""end"": 3742, ""text"": ""anemic"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 1542, ""end"": 1546, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 727, ""end"": 734, ""text"": ""pleural"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1397, ""end"": 1404, ""text"": ""pleural"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1732, ""end"": 1739, ""text"": ""pleural"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 2303, ""end"": 2310, ""text"": ""pleural"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 2303, ""end"": 2310, ""text"": ""pleural"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3098, ""end"": 3105, ""text"": ""pleural"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 727, ""end"": 734, ""text"": ""pleural"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1397, ""end"": 1404, ""text"": ""pleural"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1732, ""end"": 1739, ""text"": ""pleural"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3098, ""end"": 3105, ""text"": ""pleural"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 1386, ""end"": 1395, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1444, ""end"": 1453, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1763, ""end"": 1772, ""text"": ""pneumonia"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 978, ""end"": 987, ""text"": ""tachypnic"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1518, ""end"": 1537, ""text"": ""shortness of breath"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1060, ""end"": 1068, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 1591, ""end"": 1599, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Skin and soft tissue"", ""Respiratory""]}",Abdominal,4,538,2023-05-08T10:43:48.415949Z,2023-05-08T10:43:48.415988Z,131.535

pt has baseline plt ct 50-70s, trended down to 40 & heparin products held [**2163-1-24**]. plts have been stable. suspician of hit very low and hit ab never sent from lab. heparin products were held. . #sacral decub/intertriguinous rash - was seen by the wound care nurse [**first name (titles) **] [**last name (titles) 7219**] implemented for wound care.  also placed on kinair mattress with regular position changes.  was given antifungal cream as well. . #nutrition pleasure feeds with pureed nectar thickened feeds (maintained on aspiration precautions). . code status: dnr/dni, no lines, no pressors . on [**1-31**], patient rapidly became hypotensive and unresponsive and expired.  family was notified.",578,"[{""start"": 771, ""end"": 780, ""text"": ""urosepsis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 859, ""end"": 868, ""text"": ""urosepsis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 1636, ""end"": 1645, ""text"": ""urosepsis"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 102, ""end"": 109, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2053, ""end"": 2060, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2113, ""end"": 2120, ""text"": "" renal "", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 301, ""end"": 305, ""text"": "" uti"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2164, ""end"": 2167, ""text"": ""atn"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2436, ""end"": 2441, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 2463, ""end"": 2468, ""text"": ""urine"", ""labels"": [""Urosepsis""]}, {""start"": 678, ""end"": 684, ""text"": "" line "", ""labels"": [""Catheter-associated""]}, {""start"": 1768, ""end"": 1774, ""text"": ""cardio"", ""labels"": [""Endocarditis""]}, {""start"": 4110, ""end"": 4115, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 4200, ""end"": 4205, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 22, ""end"": 26, ""text"": "" hip"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 157, ""end"": 161, ""text"": "" hip"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 190, ""end"": 194, ""text"": "" hip"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 368, ""end"": 372, ""text"": "" hip"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 644, ""end"": 648, ""text"": "" hip"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 3291, ""end"": 3295, ""text"": "" hip"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 4087, ""end"": 4091, ""text"": ""rash"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 2675, ""end"": 2682, ""text"": ""pleural"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 2675, ""end"": 2682, ""text"": ""pleural"", ""labels"": [""Skin and soft tissue""]}, {""start"": 4110, ""end"": 4115, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 4200, ""end"": 4205, ""text"": ""wound"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 23, ""end"": 26, ""text"": ""hip"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 158, ""end"": 161, ""text"": ""hip"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 191, ""end"": 194, ""text"": ""hip"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 369, ""end"": 372, ""text"": ""hip"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 645, ""end"": 648, ""text"": ""hip"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 3292, ""end"": 3295, ""text"": ""hip"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 3369, ""end"": 3374, ""text"": ""joint"", ""labels"": [""Bone and joints""]}, {""start"": 3006, ""end"": 3016, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 620, ""end"": 623, ""text"": ""pna"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 2591, ""end"": 2599, ""text"": ""intubate"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 3006, ""end"": 3016, ""text"": ""intubation"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}, {""start"": 4390, ""end"": 4400, ""text"": ""aspiration"", ""labels"": [""Respiratory""]}]",Urosepsis,None of the above,"{""choices"": [""Skin and soft tissue"", ""Respiratory""]}",4,537,2023-05-08T10:41:35.275474Z,2023-05-08T10:41:35.275506Z,56.585
